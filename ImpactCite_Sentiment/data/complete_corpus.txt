W96-0101	A92-1018	o	"1 Introduction In the part-of-speech hterature, whether taggers are based on a rule-based approach (Klein and Simmons, 1963), (Brill, 1992), (Voutilainen, 1993), or on a statistical one (Bahl and Mercer, 1976), (Leech et al. , 1983), (Merialdo, 1994), (DeRose, 1988), (Church, 1989), (Cutting et al. , 1992), there is a debate as to whether more attention should be paid to lexical probabilities rather than contextual ones."
W96-0101	A92-1018	o	"5 Comparison with other approaches In some sense, this approach is similar to the notion of ""ambiguity classes"" explained in (Kupiec, 1992) and (Cutting et al. , 1992) where words that belong to the same part-of-speech figure together."
W96-0101	A92-1018	o	"(Chanod and Tapanainen, 1995) compare two tagging frameworks for tagging French, one that is statistical, built upon the Xerox tagger (Cutting et al. , 1992), and another based on linguistic constraints only."
W96-0102	A92-1018	o	"Most work on statistical methods has used n-gram models or Hidden Markov Model-based taggers (e.g. Church, 1988; DeRose, 1988; Cutting et al. 1992; Merialdo, 1994, etc.)."
W96-0113	A92-1018	o	"Kupiec (1992) has proposed an estimation method for the N-gram language model using the Baum-Welch reestimation algorithm (Rabiner et al. , 1994) from an untagged corpus and Cutting et al."
W96-0205	A92-1018	o	"Generalized Forward Backward Reestimation Generalization of the Forward and Viterbi Algorithm In English part of speech taggers, the maximization of Equation (1) to get the most likely tag sequence, is accomplished by the Viterbi algorithm (Church, 1988), and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of Equation (2) are obtained from untagged corpus by the ForwardBackward algorithm (Cutting et al. , 1992)."
W96-0206	A92-1018	o	"The accuracy of the derived model depends heavily on the initial bias, but with a good choice results are comparable to those of method three (Cutting et al. , 1992)."

W99-0608	A92-1018	o	"2.2 STT: A Statistical Tree-based Tagger The aim of statistical or probabilistic tagging (Church, 1988; Cutting et al. , 1992) is to assign the most likely sequence of tags given the observed sequence of words."
C04-1147	C02-1007	o	"Examples of such affinities include synonyms (Terra and Clarke, 2003), verb similarities (Resnik and Diab, 2000) and word associations (Rapp, 2002)."
D08-1096	C02-1007	n	"Several papers have looked at higher-order representations, but have not examined the equivalence of syn/para distributions when formalized as Markov chains (Schutze and Pedersen, 1993; Lund and Burgess, 1996; Edmonds, 1997; Rapp, 2002; Biemann et al., 2004; Lemaire and Denhi`ere, 2006)."
D09-1066	C02-1007	o	"Roughly in keeping with (Rapp, 2002), we hereby regard paradigmatic assocations as those based largely on word similarity (i.e. including those typically classed as synonyms, antonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms etc), whereas syntagmatic associations are all those words which strongly invoke one another yet which cannot readily be said to be similar."
D09-1066	C02-1007	o	"Then, by using evaluations similar to those described in (Baroni et al., 2008) and by Rapp (2002), we show that the best distance-based measures correlate better overall with human association scores than do the best window based configurations (see Section 4), and that they also serve as better predictors of the strongest human associations (see Section 5)."
D09-1066	C02-1007	o	"While choosing an optimum window size for an application is often subject to trial and error, there are some generally recognized trade-offs between small versus large windows, such as the impact of data-sparseness, and the nature of the associations retrieved (Church and Hanks, 1989; Church and Hanks, 1991; Rapp, 2002) Measures based on distance between words in the text."
D09-1066	C02-1007	o	"3 Methodology Similar to (Rapp, 2002; Baroni et al., 2008, among others), we use comparison to human assocation datasets as a test bed for the scores produced by computational association measures."
D09-1066	C02-1007	o	"We use evaluations similar to those used before (Rapp, 2002; Pado and Lapata, 2007; Baroni et al., 2008, among others)."
E09-1098	C02-1007	o	"At the present time, given the key role of window size in determining the selection and apparent strength of associations under the conventional co-occurrence model highlighted here and in the works of Church et al (1991), Rapp (2002), Wang (2005), and Schulte im Walde & Melinger (2008) we would urge that this is an issue which window-driven studies continue to conscientiously address; at the very least, scale is a parameter which findings dependent on distributional phenomena must be qualified in light of."
E09-1098	C02-1007	o	"As, Rapp (2002) observes, choosing a window size involves making a trade-off between various qualities."
E09-1098	C02-1007	o	"Rapp (2002) calls this trade-off specificity; equivalent observations were made by Church & Hanks (1989) and Church et al (1991), who refer to the tendency for large windows to wash out, smear or defocus those associations exhibited at smaller scales."
E09-1098	C02-1007	o	"2.1 Scale-dependence It has been shown that varying the size of the context considered for a word can impact upon the performance of applications (Rapp, 2002; Yarowsky & Florian, 2002), there being no ideal window size for all applications."
E09-1098	C02-1007	o	2.2 Data sparseness Another facet of the general trade-off identified by Rapp (2002) pertains to how limitations in862 herent in the combination of data and cooccurrence retrieval method are manifest.
E09-1098	C02-1007	o	"This is one manifestation of what is commonly referred to as the data sparseness problem, and was discussed by Rapp (2002) as a side-effect of specificity."
P04-3026	C02-1007	o	"Whereas until recently the focus of research had been on sense disambiguation, papers like Pantel & Lin (2002), Neill (2002), and Rapp (2003) give evidence that sense induction now also attracts attention."
P04-3026	C02-1007	o	"3 Algorithm As in previous work (Rapp, 2002), our computations are based on a partially lemmatized version of the British National Corpus (BNC) which has the function words removed."
P04-3026	C02-1007	o	"We used the procedure described in Rapp (2002), with the only modification being the multiplication of the loglikelihood values with a triangular function that depends on the logarithm of a words frequency."
P09-1051	C02-1007	o	"(Ruge, 1992; Rapp, 2002))."
W04-2117	C02-1007	o	"Even though there are some studies that compare the results from statistically computed association measures with word association norms from psycholinguistic experiments (Landauer et al. , 1998; Rapp, 2002) there has not been any research on the usage of a digital, network-based dictionary reflecting the organisation of the mental lexicon to our knowledge."
W04-2117	C02-1007	o	There are several other approaches such as Ji and Ploux (2003) and the already mentioned Rapp (2002).
C08-1040	C04-1162	o	"For example it has been used to measure centrality in hyperlinked web pages networks (Brin and Page, 1998; Kleinberg, 1998), lexical networks (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Kurland and Lee, 2005; Kurland and Lee, 2006), and semantic networks (Mihalcea et al., 2004)."
C08-1040	C04-1162	o	"Our method is based on the ones described in (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Fader et al., 2007), The objective of this paper is to dynamically rank speakers or participants in a discussion."
D07-1069	C04-1162	p	"Eigenvector centrality in particular has been successfully applied to many different types of networks, including hyperlinked web pages (Brin and Page, 1998; Kleinberg, 1998), lexical networks (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Kurland and Lee, 2005; Kurland and Lee, 2006), and semantic networks (Mihalcea et al. , 2004)."
E09-3009	C04-1162	o	"Still, it is in our next plans and part of our future work to embed in our model some of the interesting WSD approaches, like knowledgebased (Sinha and Mihalcea, 2007; Brody et al., 2006), corpus-based (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2005; McCarthy et al., 2004), or combinations with very high accuracy (Montoyo et al., 2005)."
E09-3009	C04-1162	n	"This method was preferred against other related methods, like the one introduced in (Mihalcea et al., 2004), since it embeds all the available semantic information existing in WordNet, even edges that cross POS, thus offering a richer semantic representation."
H05-1052	C04-1162	o	"417 structure of semantic networks was proposed in (Mihalcea et al. , 2004), with a disambiguation accuracy of 50.9% measured on all the words in the SENSEVAL-2 data set."
I05-2004	C04-1162	o	"Previous approaches include supervised learning (Hirao et al. , 2002), (Teufel and Moens, 1997), vectorial similarity computed between an initial abstract and sentences in the given document, intradocument similarities (Salton et al. , 1997), or graph algorithms (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), (Erkan and Radev, 2004), (Wolf and Gibson, 2004)."
I05-2004	C04-1162	o	"Ranking algorithms, such as Kleinbergs HITS algorithm (Kleinberg, 1999) or Googles PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998), have been traditionally and successfully used in Web-link analysis (Brin and Page, 1998), social networks, and more recently in text processing applications (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), (Mihalcea et al. , 2004), (Erkan and Radev, 2004)."
N06-1027	C04-1162	o	"Inspired by the idea of graph based algorithms to collectively rank and select the best candidate, research efforts in the natural language community have applied graph-based approaches on keyword selection (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), text summarization (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea, 2004), word sense disambiguation (Mihalcea et al. , 2004; Mihalcea, 2005), sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2004), and sentence retrieval for question answering (Otterbacher et al. , 2005)."
P04-3020	C04-1162	o	"Such text-oriented ranking methods can be applied to tasks ranging from automated extraction of keyphrases, to extractive summarization and word sense disambiguation (Mihalcea et al. , 2004)."
W06-3811	C04-1162	o	"Using dictionaries as network of lexical items or senses has been quite popular for word sense disambiguation (Veronis and Ide, 1990; H.Kozima and Furugori, 1993; Niwa and Nitta, 1994) before losing ground to statistical approaches, even though (Gaume et al. , 2004; Mihalcea et al. , 2004) tried a revival of such methods."
D09-1114	C08-1005	o	"Although various approaches to SMT system combination have been explored, including enhanced combination model structure (Rosti et al., 2007), better word alignment between translations (Ayan et al., 2008; He et al., 2008) and improved confusion network construction (Rosti et al., 2008), most previous work simply used the ensemble of SMT systems based on different models and paradigms at hand and did not tackle the issue of how to obtain the ensemble in a principled way."
P09-1066	C08-1005	o	"Most of the work focused on seeking better word alignment for consensus-based confusion network decoding (Matusov et al., 2006) or word-level system combination (He et al., 2008; Ayan et al., 2008)."
D09-1073	C08-1027	o	"However, one of the major limitations of these advances is the structured syntactic knowledge, which is important to global reordering (Li et al., 2007; Elming, 2008), has not been well exploited."
D09-1008	C08-1041	o	"(He et al., 2008)."
D09-1008	C08-1041	o	"Please note that our approach is very different from other approaches to context dependent rule selection such as (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007) and (He et al., 2008)."
D09-1008	C08-1041	o	"Thus, we can compute the source dependency LM score in the same way we compute the target side score, using a procedure described in (Shen et al., 2008)."
D09-1008	C08-1041	o	"Due to the lack of a good Arabic parser compatible with the Sakhr tokenization that we used on the source side, we did not test the source dependency LM for Arabic-to-English MT. When extracting rules with source dependency structures, we applied the same well-formedness constraint on the source side as we did on the target side, using a procedure described by (Shen et al., 2008)."
D09-1008	C08-1041	o	"A remedy is to aggressively limit the feature space, e.g. to syntactic labels or a small fraction of the bi-lingual features available, as in (Chiang et al., 2008; Chiang et al., 2009), but that reduces the benefit of lexical features."
D09-1008	C08-1041	o	"In (Post and Gildea, 2008; Shen et al., 2008), target trees were employed to improve the scoring of translation theories."
D09-1008	C08-1041	o	"A few studies (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007; He et al., 2008; Hasan et al., 2008) addressed this defect by selecting the appropriate translation rules for an input span based on its context in the input sentence."
D09-1008	C08-1041	o	"The other approach is to estimate a single score or likelihood of a translation with rich features, for example, with the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) method as in (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007; He et al., 2008)."
D09-1008	C08-1041	o	"In (He et al., 2008), lexical 72 features were limited on each single side due to the feature space problem."
D09-1008	C08-1041	o	"Similar ideas were explored in (He et al., 2008)."
D09-1008	C08-1041	o	"(Carpuat and Wu, 2007) and (He et al., 2008), the specific technique we used by means of a context language model is rather different."
D09-1008	C08-1041	o	"73 1.2.2 Baseline System and Experimental Setup We take BBNs HierDec, a string-to-dependency decoder as described in (Shen et al., 2008), as our baseline for the following two reasons:  It provides a strong baseline, which ensures the validity of the improvement we would obtain."
D09-1008	C08-1041	o	"2 Linguistic and Context Features 2.1 Non-terminal Labels In the original string-to-dependency model (Shen et al., 2008), a translation rule is composed of a string of words and non-terminals on the source side and a well-formed dependency structure on the target side."
E09-1044	C08-1064	o	"Previously published approaches to reducing the rule set include: enforcing a minimum span of two words per non-terminal (Lopez, 2008), which would reduce our set to 115M rules; or a minimum count (mincount) threshold (Zollmann et al., 2008), which would reduce our set to 78M (mincount=2) or 57M (mincount=3) rules."
E09-1044	C08-1064	o	Lopez (2008) explores whether lexical reordering or the phrase discontiguity inherent in hierarchical rules explains improvements over phrase-based systems.
N09-1049	C08-1064	o	Lopez (2008) explores whether lexical reordering or the phrase discontiguity inherent in hierarchical rules explains improvements over phrase-based systems.
W09-0426	C08-1064	p	"First, such a system makes use of lexical information when modeling reordering (Lopez, 2008), which has previously been shown to be useful in German-to-English translation (Koehn et al., 2008)."
W09-0437	C08-1064	o	"2 Models, Search Spaces, and Errors A translation model consists of two distinct elements: an unweighted ruleset, and a parameterization (Lopez, 2008a; 2009)."
W09-0437	C08-1064	o	Lopez (2008b) gives indirect experimental evidence that this difference affects performance.
W09-0437	C08-1064	o	"Our hierarchical system is Hiero (Chiang, 2007), modified to construct rules from a small sample of occurrences of each source phrase in training as described by Lopez (2008b)."
E09-1057	C08-1067	o	"In a next step, chunk information was added by a rule-based language-independent chunker (Macken et al., 2008) that contains distituency rules, which implies that chunk boundaries are added between two PoS codes that cannot occur in the same constituent."
E09-1057	C08-1067	p	"(Macken et al., 2008) showed that the results for French-English were competitive to state-of-the-art alignment systems."
D09-1125	C08-1074	p	"Then the same system weights are applied to both IncHMM and Joint Decoding -based approaches, and the feature weights of them are trained using the max-BLEU training method proposed by Och (2003) and refined by Moore and Quirk (2008)."
W09-0439	C08-1074	o	"Previouswork, eg (Moore and Quirk, 2008; Cer et al., 2008), has focusedonimprovingtheperformanceofPowells algorithm."
W09-0439	C08-1074	o	"Moore and Quirk (2008) share the goal underlying our own research: improving, rather than replacing, Ochs MERT procedure."
E09-1071	C08-1114	o	"One such relational reasoning task is the problem of compound noun interpretation, which has received a great deal of attention in recent years (Girju et al., 2005; Turney, 2006; Butnariu and Veale, 2008)."
E09-1071	C08-1114	o	Turney (2008) has recently proposed a simpler SVM-based algorithm for analogical classification called PairClass.
E09-1071	C08-1114	o	"Turney (2008) argues that many NLP tasks can be formulated in terms of analogical reasoning, and he applies his PairClass algorithm to a number of problems including SAT verbal analogy tests, synonym/antonym classification and distinction between semantically similar and semantically associated words."

N09-1058	C08-1114	o	"In NLP community, it has been shown that having more data results in better performance (Ravichandran et al., 2005; Brants et al., 2007; Turney, 2008)."
W09-0201	C08-1114	o	"In Table 6 we report our results, together with the state-of-the-art from the ACL wiki5 and the scores of Turney (2008) (PairClass) and from Amac Herdagdelens PairSpace system, that was trained on ukWaC."
W09-0201	C08-1114	o	2 Related work Turney (2008) recently advocated the need for a uniform approach to corpus-based semantic tasks.
W09-0201	C08-1114	o	Such tasks will require an extension of the current framework of Turney (2008) beyond evidence from the direct cooccurrence of target word pairs.
W09-0205	C08-1114	o	"Turney (2008) is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to raise the issue of a unified approach."
W09-0205	C08-1114	o	The algorithm proposed by Turney (2008) is labeled as Turney-PairClass.
W09-0205	C08-1114	o	"Building on a recent proposal in this direction by Turney (2008), we propose a generic method of this sort, and we test it on a set of unrelated tasks, reporting good performance across the board with very little task-specific tweaking."
W09-0205	C08-1114	o	We adopt a similar approach to the one used in Turney (2008) and consider each question as a separate binary classification problem with one positive training instance and 5 unknown pairs.

P09-1036	C08-1127	o	"This, unfortunately, significantly jeopardizes performance (Koehn et al., 2003; Xiong et al., 2008) because by integrating syntactic constraint into decoding as a hard constraint, it simply prohibits any other useful non-syntactic translations which violate constituent boundaries."

from WordNet to Hector senses m Senseval provides a ""gold standard"" against wluch to judge our ability to compare lexlcal resources The ""gold standard"" is provided through a word overlap analysis (with and without a stop list) for flus mapping, achieving at most a 36 percent correct mapping (inflated by 9 percent from ""empty"" assignments) An alternaUve componenttal analysis of the defimtaons, using syntacUc, collocatmnal, and semantac component and relation identification (through the use ofdefimng patterns integrated seamlessly mto the parsing thclaonary), provides an almost 41 percent correct mapping, with an additaonal 4 percent by recogmzmg semantic components not used in the Senseval mapping Defimtion sets of the Senseval words from three pubhshed thclaonanes and Dorr's lextcal knowledge base were added to WordNet and the Hector database to exanune the nature of the mapping process between defimtton sets of more and less sco\[~e The tecbauques described here consUtute only an maaal implementation of the componenUal analysis approach and suggests that considerable further improvements can be aclueved Introduction The difficulty of companng lemcal resources, long a s~gnfficant challenge in computauonal hnguistlcs (Atlans, 1991), came to the fore in the recent Senseval competatton (IOlgarnff, 1998), when some systems that relied heavily on the WordNet (Miller, et al, 1990) sense inventory were faced with the necessity of using another sense inventory (Hecto0 A hasty solutaon to the problem was the "" development of a map between the two inventories, but some part~cipants expressed concerns that use of flus map may have degraded their performance to an unknown degree Although there were disclaimers about the WordNet-Hector map, it nonetheless stands as a usable gold standard for efforts to compare lexical resources Moreover, we have a usable baseline (a word overlap method suggested m (Lesk, 1986)) against which to compare whether we are able to make improvements m the mapping (since flus method has been shown to perform not as well as expected (Krovetz, 1992)) We first describe the lextcal resources used m the study (Hector, WordNet, other dicUonanes, and a lex~cal knowledge base), first characterizing them in terms ofpolysemy and the types of leracal mformaUon each contmns (syntacUc properties and features, semantac components and relaUons, and collocaUonal properties) We then present results of perfornung the word overlap analysis of the 18 verbs used m Senseval, analyzing the definitions m WordNet and Hector We then expand our analysis to include other dictionaries We describe our methods of analysis, particularly the methods of parsing defimtaons and identff)qng semantic relations (semrels) based on defimng patterns, essentially takang first steps m Implementing the program described by Atkms and focusmg on the use of""meamng"" full mformataon rather than statistical mformaUon We identify the results that have been achieved thus far and outline further steps that may add more ""meanmg"" to the analysis IAll analyses described m this paper were performed automatically using functlonahty

used In Senseval (not ichoms and phrases), specifically the followmg AMAZE, BAND, BET, BOTHER, BURY, CALCULATE, CONSUME, DERIVE, FLOAT, HURDLE, INVADE, PROMISE, SACK, SANCTION, SCRAP, SEIZE, SHAKE, SLIGHT The Hector database used In Senseval consists of a tree of senses, each of which contains defimttons, syntactic properties, example usages, and ""clues"" (collocational information about the syntactic and semantic enwronment in wluch a word appears in the spectfic sense) The WordNet database contmns synonyms (synsets), perhaps a defimtton or example usages (gloss), some syntactic mformaUon (verb frames), hypernyms, hyponyms, and some other semrels (ENTAILS, CAUSES) To extend our analysis In order to look at other issues of lexacal resource comparison, we have included the defirauons or leracal information from the following additional sources  Webster's 3 ra New International Dictionary (W3)  Oxford Advanced l.earners D~ctlonary (OALD)  American Hentage DlcUonary (AI-ID)  Dorr's Lexacal Knowledge Base (Dorr) We used only the defimuons from W3, OALD, and AHD (which also contmn sample usages and some collocattonal information m the form of usage notes, not used

baseline for automatic replication of the lexicographer's mappmg from WordNet 1 6 to Hector, using a s~mple word overlap analysis smular to (Lesk, 1986) The lextcographer mapped the 66 WordNet senses (each synset m which a test occurred) Into 102 Hector senses A total of 86 assignments were made, 9 WordNet senses were gwen no assignments, 40 recewed exactly one, and 17 senses received 2 or 3 asssgnments The WordNet senses contained 348 words (about half of wluch were common words appeanng on our stop list, which contained 165 words, mostly preposmons, pronouns, and conjunctions) The Hector senses selected m the word overlap analysis contained about 960 words (all Hector senses contained 1878 words) We performed a strict word overlap analysts (with and wsthout a stop hst) between tile definlUons in WordNet and the Hector senses, that is, we did not attempt to ldenttfy root forms of Inflected words We took each word m a WordNet sense and determined whether ~t appeared in a Hector sense, we selected a Hector sense based on the highest percentage of words over all Hector senses An 31 empty selection was made ff all the words in the WordNet sense did not appear in any Hector sense, only content words were considered when the stop hst was used For example, for bet, WordNet sense 2 (stake (money) on the outcome of an issue) mapped into Hector sense 4 ((of a person) to risk (a sum of money or property) m thts way) In this case, there was an overlap on two words (money, 039 in the Hector defimtlon (0 13 of its 15 words) without the stop list When the stop list was invoked, there was an overlap of only one word (money, 0 07 of the Hector defimtion) In this case, the lexicographer had made three assignments (Hector senses 2, 3, and 4), our scoring method treated flus as only 1 out of 3 correct (not using the relaxed method employed in Senseval of treating flus as completely correct) Without the stop hst, our selections matched the lexicographer's in 28 of 86 cases (32 6%), using the stop list, we were successful in 31 of 86 cases (36 1%) The improvement arising when the stop list was used is deceptive, where 8 cases were due to empty assignments (so that only 23 cases, 26 7%, were due to matching content words) Overall, only 41 content words were involved in these 23 successes when the stop list was used, an average of I 8 content words To summanze the word overlap analysis (1) despite a ncher set of defimtions in Hector, 9 of 66 WordNet senses (13 6%) could not be assigned, (2) despite the greater detail in Hector senses compared to WordNet senses (2 8 times as many words), only 1 8 content words participated in the assignments, and (3) therefore, the defimng vocabulary between these two definition sets seems to be somewhat divergent Although it might appear as if the word overlap analysis does not perform well, this is not the case The analysis provides a broad overview of the defimuon companson process between two definmon sets and frames a deeper analysis of the differences Moreover, it appears that the accuracy of a ""gold standard"" mapping is not crucially important The quality of the mapping may help frame the subsequent analysis more precisely, but it seems sufficient that any reasonable mapping will suffice This will be discussed further after presenting the results of the componentlal analysis of the defimtlons 32 Meaning-Full Analysis of Definitions The deeper analysis of the mapping between two defimtion sets relies primarily on two major steps (1) parsing definitions and using defimng patterns to identify semrels present m the definitions and (2) relaxing values to these relations by allowing ""synonymic"" substitution (using WordNet) Thus, for example, ffwe identify hypernyms or instruments from parsing a defimtion, we would say that the defimtions are ""equal"" not just ffthe hypernym or instrument is the same word, but also Lf the hypernyms or instruments are members of the same synset This approach is based on the finding (Litkowski, 1978) that a dictionary induces a semantic network where nodes represent ""concepts"" that may be lexicahzed and verbalized in more than one way This finding implies, in general, the absence of true synonyms, and instead the kind of ""concept"" embodied in WordNet synsets (with several lexical items and phraseologles) A slmdar approach, parsing defimtlons and relaxing semrel values, was followed in (Dolan, 1994) for clnstenng related senses w~thin a single dictionary The ideal toward which this approach strives is a complete identification of the meamng components included in a defimtion The meaning components can include syntactic features and charactenstlcs (including subcategonzation patterns), semantm components (realized through identification of semrels), selectional restrictions, and coUocational specifications The first stage of the analysis parses the definitions (CL Research, 1999b, Litkowski, to appear) and uses the parse results to extract (via defining patterns) semrels Since definitions have many idiosyncrasies (that do not follow ordinary text), an important first step in this stage is preprocessmg the definition text to put it into a sentence frame that facilitates the extraction of semrels 2 2Note that the stop hst is not applicable to the definition parsing The parser is a full-scale sentence parser, where prepositmns and other words on the stop list are necessary for successful parsing Moreover, inclusion of the prepositions is cmcml to the method, since they are the bearers of much semrel information The extractmn of semrels examines the parse results, a e, a tree whose mtermedaate nodes represent non-ternunals and whose leaves represent the lextcal atems that compnse the defimuons, where any node may also include annotations such as characterizations of number and tense For all noun or verb defimttons, flus includes Identification of the head noun (with recogmtton of""empty"" heads) or verb, for verbs, we signal whether the defimtaon contmned any selecttonal restnctmus (that as, pamcular parenthesazed expressaons) for the subject and object We then exanune preposattonal phrases In the defimUon and deterrmne whether we have a ""defining pattern"" for the preposaUon whach we can use as mdacaUve of a partacular semrel We also identify adverbs m the parse tree and look these up in WordNet to adentffy an adjecuve synset from wluch they are derived (if one is gwen) The defimng pattems are actually part of the dictionary used by the parser That is, we do not have to develop specafic routines to look for specLfic patterns A defimng pattern ~s a regular expressaon that arlaculates a syntactac pattern to be matched Thus, to recograze a ""manner"" semrel, we have the foUowmg entry for ""m"" m(dpat((~ rep0 l(det(0)) adj manner(0) st(manner)))) This allows us to recognize ""m"" as possibly gwmg rise to a ""manner"" component, where we recogmze ""m"" (the tdde, which allows us to specify partacular elements before the ""m"" as well), vath a noun phrase that consasts of 0 or 1 determiner, an adjectwe, and the lateral ""manner"" The '0  after the detenmner and the hteral mdacate that these words are not copied into the value for a ""manner"" role, so that the value to the ""manner"" semrel becomes only the adjectwe that as recogmzed The second stage of the analysis uses the populated lexacal database to compare senses and make the selectaons This process follows the general methodology used m Senseval (Lltkowska, to appear) Specifically, m the defimtaon comparison, we first exanune exclusaon cntena to rule out specific mappings These criteria include syntacUc properUes (e g, a verb sense that Is only transluve cannot map into one that Is only mtransRave) and collocataonal propertaes (e g, a sense that is used with a parUcle cannot map into one that uses a different particle) At the present tune, these are used only rmmmally 33 We next score each viable sense based on rots semrels We increment the score ff the senses have a common hypernym or If a sense's hypernyms belong  to the same synset as the other sense's hypernyms If a parUcular sense con~ns a large number of synonyms (that as, no differentiae on the hypernym) and they overlap consaderably m the synsets they evoke, the score can be increased substanUally Currently, we add 5 points for each match 3 We increment the score based on common semrels In tins amtml tmplementaUon, we have defimng patterns (usually qmte nummal) for recogmzmg Instrument, means, location, purpose, source, manner, has-constituents, has-members, is-part-of, locale, and goal 4 We Increment the score by 2 points when we have a common semrel and then by another 5 points when the value Is ~dentacal or m the same synset After all possable increments to the scores have been made, we then select the sense(s) w~th the lughest score Finally, we compare our selecuon with that of the gold standard to assess our mapping over all senses Another way an wluch our methodology follows the Senseval process as that at proceeds incrementally Thus, ~t ms not necessary to have a ""final"" perfect parse and mapping rouUne We can make conUnual refinements at any stage of the process and exarmne the overall effect As m Senseval, we may make changes to deal wath a particular phenomenon with the result that overall performance dechnes, but w~th a sounder basis for making subsequent amprovements Results of Componential Analysis The ""gold standard"" analysis Involves mapping 66 WordNet senses with 348 words into 102 Hector senses with 1878 words Using the method described above, we obtained 35 out of 86 correct 3At the present tame, we use WordNet to adentffy semreis We envaslon usmg the full semanlac network created by parsing all a dlcUonary's defimtaons Thas would include a richer set of semrels than currently included m WordNet 4The defimng patterns are developed by hand We have onlyJust begun this effort, so the current set ms somewhat Impoverished mappmgs (407%), a shght improvement over the 31 correct assignments usmg the stop-last word overlap techmque However, as mentioned above, the stophst techmque had aclueved 8 of its successes by matclung null assignments Consadered on tlus basins, ~t seems that the componentaal analysis techmque provides substantial ~mprovement In addition, our technique ""erred"" on 4 cases by malang assagnments where none were made by the leracographer We suggest that these cases do con~n some common elements of meaning and may conceivably not be construed as errors The mapping from WordNet to Hector had relatavely few empty mappings, senses for wtuch It was not possable to make an assignment These are the cases where at appears that the chetmnanes do not overlap and thus prowde a tentative mdacataon of where two dictionaries may have different coverage The cases of multiple assignments mchcate the degree ofamblgmty m the mapping The average m both darecUons between Hector and WordNet were donunated by the mabdaty to obtain good dascnnunatton for the word ""semze"" Thus, tlus method identifies individual words where the &scnnunatwe ablhty needs to be further refined  Perhaps more importantly, the componentml analysis method exploits consaderably more WordNet Hector  mformauon than the word overlap methods Whereas the stop-hst word overlap mapping was  based on only 41 content words, the componenual ~ approach (In the selected mappings) had 228 hits in ~.~  developing ats scores, with only a small number of ~ .~ ~ defining patterns Comparison of Dictionaries tel O ~3 0'3 We next exanuned the nature of the mterrelalaons between parrs of chctaonanes w~thout use of a ""gold standard"" to assess the process of mapping For t/us purpose, we mapped m both &recttons between the paars {WordNet, Hector}, {W3, OALD}, and {W3, AHD We exanune Dorr's lexacal knowledge base for the amphcatlons It may have m the mapping process Neither WordNet nor Hector are properly v~ewed as chcuonanes, since there was no mtenuon to pubhsh them as such WordNet ""glosses"" are generally smaller (53 words per sense) compared to Hector (184 words per sense), whach contains many words specff3nng selectmnal restnct~ons on the subject and object of the

47 06 17 119 Hector-WN 57 64 14 22 113 These points are further emphasized m the mapping between W3 and OALD, where the disparity between the empty and mulUple assagnments indicate that we are mapping between dictionaries qmte disparate This tends to be the case not only for the enUre set of words, but also is evident for individual words where there is a considerable d~spanty m the number of senses, wtuch then dominate the overall dlspanty Thus, for example, W3 has 41 defimUons for ""float"", while OALD has 10 We tend to be unable to find the specific sense m going from W3 to OALD, because at is likely that we have many more specific defimtlons that are not present In the other direction, we are hkely to have considerable ambiguity and multiple assignments W3-OALD OALD-W3 W3

considerably more semanuc components than we are currently able to recogmze, we dad not pursue this avenue any further at flus time More important than just mappmg between two words, Dorr's data mdacates the posstbday of further exploitation of a richer set of semanUc components Spectfically, as reported m (Olsen, et al, 1998), m descnbmg procedures for automatically acqumng thematic grids for Mandann Chinese, ~t was noted that ""verbs that incorporate themaUc elements m their meamng would not allow that element to appear m the complement structure"" Thus, by usmg Dorr's thematic grids when verb are parsed m defimtaons, it ~s possible to ~dentffy where partacular semantac components are lexicahzed and which others are transnutted through to the themaUc grid (complement or subcategonzataon pattern) for the defimendum The transmiss~on of semantic components to the thematic gnd ~s also reflected overtly m many defimtlons For example, shake has one definition, ""to bnng to a specified condatton by or as ffby repeated qmck jerky movements"" We would thus expect that the thematac grid for this defimtaon should include a ""goal"" And, deed, Dorr's database has two senses whch reqmre a ""goal"" as part of their thematic grid Smularly, for many defimtaons m the sample set, we ~dentLfied a source defimng pattern based on the word ""from,"" frequently, the object of the preposmon was the word ""source"" ttseff, mdacatmg that the subcategonzaUon, properties of the defimendum should elude a source component Discussion Wlule the improvement m mapping by using the componentaal analysis techmque (over the word overlap methods) is modest, we consider these results qmte slgmficant m wew of the very small number of defimng patterns we have Implemented Most of the improvement stems from the word substatuUon pnnclple described earlier (as ewdenced by the preponderance of 5 point scores) This techmque also provides a mechamsm for bnngmg back the stop words, wz, the preposmons, wluch are the careers of mformatmn about semrels (the 2 point scores) The more general conclusion (from the word subsutuuon) is that the success arises from no longer considenng a defimtmn m ~solation The proper context for a word and its defimtions consists not .lUSt of the words that make up the definition, but also the total semantac network represented by the dictaonary We have aclueved our results by explomng only a small part of that network We have moved only a few steps to that network beyond the mdawdual words and their definitions We would expect that further expansmn, first by the addon of further and ~mproved semrel defining patterns, and second, through the identaficataon of more pnmmve semanuc components, will add considerably to our abflay to map between lexacal resources We also expect ~mprovements from consideration of other techniques, such as attempts at ontology ahgnment (Hovy, 1998) Although tile definition analysis provlded here was performed on definmons with a stogie language, the vanous meamng components m m m m m m m m 35 correspond to those used in an Interhngua The use of the exUncuon method (developed m order to charactenze verbs m another language, Clunese) can frmtfully be applied here as well Two further observaUons about tlus process can be made The first is that rchance on a wellestablished semantic network such as WordNet,s not necessary The componenUal analysis method rehes on the local neighborhood of words m the defimUons, not on the completeness of the network Indeed, the network ~tsel can be bootstrapped based on the parsing results The method can work vath any semanUc network or ontology and may be used to refine or flesh out the network or ontology The second observation is that it is not necessary to have a well-estabhshed ""gold standard"" Any mapping vail do All that Is necessary is for any mvesugator (lemcographer or not) to create a judgmental mappmg The methods employed here can then quanufy ttus mapping based on a word overlap analysis and then further examine tt based on the componenaal analysis The componenUal analysis method can then be used to exanune underlying subtleUes and nuances tn the defimUous, wluch a lemcographer or analyst can then examine m further detail to assess the mapping Future Work Tlus work has marked the first ume that all the necessary mfrastructure has been combmed tn a rudimentary form Because of its rudimentary status, the opportumUes for improvement are quite extensive In addlUon, there are many opportumUes for using the techmques descnbed here m further NLP apphcatlons First, the techmques described here have immediate apphcabtllty as part of a lexicographer's workstaUon When defimUons are parsed and semrels are zdenttfied, the resulUng data structures can be apphed against a corpus of instances for parUcular words (as m Senseval) for improving word-sense disamblguaUon The techmques will also permit comparing an entry vath Itself to deternune the mterrelattonshtps among ~ts defimUons and of companng the defimUons of two ""synonyms"" to deternune the amount of overlap between them on a defimtlon by defimUon bas~s Although the analys,s here has focused on the parsing of defimUous, the development of defimng patterns clearly extends to generalized text parsing since the defimng patterns have been incorporated mto the same chcttonary used for parsing free text, the patterns can be used threctly to identify the presence of parUcular semrels among sentenual consUtuents We are working to integrate th~s funcUonahty into our word-sense &sambiguaUon techruques (both the defimng patterns and the semrels) Even further, mt seems that matclung defimng patterns in free text can be used for lextcal acquisition Textual matenal that contains these patterns could concewably be flagged as providing defimUonal matenal which can then be compared to emstmg defimUons to assess whether their use ts cous,stent vath these defimUons, and ff not, at least to flag the inconsistency The tecluuques descnbed here can be apphed directly to the fields of ontology development and analysis of ternunologlcal databases For ontoiogles, vath or w~thout defimuons, the methods employed can be used to compare entries m dai'erent ontologles based pnmanly on the relattous m the ontology, both luerarclucal and other For ternunologlcal databases, the methods descnbed here can be used to exanune the set of conceptual relaUons lmphed by the defimtmus The defimuon parsing wall facd~tate the development of the termmolog~ca I network tn the pamcular field covered by the database The componenUal analysts methods result m a richer semantic network that can be used m other apphcattous Thus, for example, ~t ts possible to extend the leracal chatmng methods described m (Green, 1997), which are based on the semrels used m WordNet The semrels developed with the componenttal analysis method would provide additional detad available for apphcauon of lexlcal cohesion methods In particular, addtUonal relattous would penmt some structunng wmthm the individual leracal chams, rather than just consldenng each cham as an amorphous set (Green, 1999) Finally, we are currently investigating the use of the componenUal analysts techmque for mformauon extracUon The techmque identifies (from defimtlous) slots that can be used as slots or fields m template generataon Once these slots are identified, we wall be attemptmg to extract slot values from Items m large catalog databases (mdhons of items) 36 In conclusion, it would seem that, instead of a paucity of tnformation allovang us to compare lexmal resources, by bnngmg m the full semantic network of the lexicon, we are overwhelmed with a plethora of

C08-1100	C98-2122	p	"4.1 Features We used a dependency structure as the context for words because it is the most widely used and one of the best performing contextual information in the past studies (Ruge, 1997; Lin, 1998)."
C08-1107	C98-2122	o	"Given a wordq, its set of featuresFq and feature weightswq(f) for f Fq, a common symmetric similarity measure is Lin similarity (Lin, 1998a): Lin(u,v) = summationtext fFuFv[wu(f)+wv(f)]summationtext fFu wu(f)+ summationtext fFv wv(f) where the weight of each feature is the pointwise mutual information (pmi) between the word and the feature: wq(f) =log[Pr(f|q)Pr(f) ]."
C08-1107	C98-2122	o	"Texts are represented by dependency parse trees (using the Minipar parser (Lin, 1998b)) and templates by parse sub-trees."

D08-1007	C98-2122	o	"Lin (1998a)s similar word list for eat misses these but includes sleep (ranked 6) and sit (ranked 14), because these have similar subjects to eat."
D08-1007	C98-2122	o	"Discriminative, context-specific training seems to yield a better set of similar predicates, e.g. the highest-ranked contexts for DSPcooc on the verb join,3 lead 1.42, rejoin 1.39, form 1.34, belong to 1.31, found 1.31, quit 1.29, guide 1.19, induct 1.19, launch (subj) 1.18, work at 1.14 give a better SIMS(join) for Equation (1) than the top similarities returned by (Lin, 1998a): participate 0.164, lead 0.150, return to 0.148, say 0.143, rejoin 0.142, sign 0.142, meet 0.142, include 0.141, leave 0.140, work 0.137 Other features are also weighted intuitively."

D08-1007	C98-2122	p	Erk (2007) compared a number of techniques for creating similar-word sets and found that both the Jaccard coefficient and Lin (1998a)s information-theoretic metric work best.
D08-1048	C98-2122	o	"They have been successfully applied in several tasks, such as information retrieval (Salton et al., 1975) and harvesting thesauri (Lin, 1998)."

D08-1084	C98-2122	p	"This similarity score is computed as a max over a number of component scoring functions, some based on external lexical resources, including:  various string similarity functions, of which most are applied to word lemmas  measures of synonymy, hypernymy, antonymy, and semantic relatedness, including a widelyused measure due to Jiang and Conrath (1997), based on manually constructed lexical resources such as WordNet and NomBank  a function based on the well-known distributional similarity metric of Lin (1998), which automatically infers similarity of words and phrases from their distributions in a very large corpus of English text The ability to leverage external lexical resources both manually and automatically constructedis critical to the success of MANLI."
D08-1103	C98-2122	o	"Distributional measures of distance, such as those proposed by Lin (1998), quantify how similar the two sets of contexts of a target word pair are."

D08-1103	C98-2122	o	Again we used Mohammad and Hirsts (2006) method along with Lins (1998) distributional measure to determine the distributional closeness of two thesaurus concepts.
D09-1028	C98-2122	o	Curran (2002) and Lin (1998) use syntactic features in the vector definition.
D09-1084	C98-2122	o	"Accurate measurement of semantic similarity between lexical units such as words or phrases is important for numerous tasks in natural language processing such as word sense disambiguation (Resnik, 1995), synonym extraction (Lin, 1998a), and automatic thesauri generation (Curran, 2002)."

W08-2211	C98-2122	o	"For every pair of nouns, where each noun had a total frequency in the triple data of 10 or more, we computed their distributional similarity using the measure given by Lin (1998)."
W09-0201	C98-2122	o	"Concept similarity is often measured by vectors of co-occurrence with context words that are typed with dependency information (Lin, 1998; Curran and Moens, 2002)."
W09-0203	C98-2122	p	"Whereas dependency based semantic spaces have been shown to surpass other word space models for a number of problems (Pad and Lapata, 2007; Lin, 1998), for the task of categorisation simple pattern based spaces have been shown to perform equally good if not better (Poesio and Almuhareb, 2005b; Almuhareb and Poesio, 2005b)."
W09-0203	C98-2122	o	In particular we work with dependency paths that can reach beyond direct dependencies as opposed to Lin (1998) but in the line of Pado and Lapata (2007).
W09-0203	C98-2122	o	As a basis mapping function  we used a generalisation of the one used by Grefenstette (1994) and Lin (1998).

D09-1024	D07-1006	o	"1 Introduction Word alignment is a critical component in training statistical machine translation systems and has received a significant amount of research, for example, (Brown et al., 1993; Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005; Fraser and Marcu, 2007), including work leveraging syntactic parse trees, e.g., (Cherry and Lin, 2006; DeNero and Klein, 2007; Fossum et al., 2008)."

W08-0306	D07-1006	p	"However, except for (Fraser and Marcu, 2007b), none of these advances in alignment quality has improved translation quality of a state-of-the-art system."
W08-0306	D07-1006	o	"In contrast to the semi-supervised LEAF alignment algorithm of (Fraser and Marcu, 2007b), which requires 1,5002,000 CPU days per iteration to align 8.4M ChineseEnglish sentences (anonymous, p.c.), link deletion requires only 450 CPU hours to re-align such a corpus (after initial alignment by GIZA++, which requires 20-24 CPU days)."
W08-0306	D07-1006	o	"However, (Fraser and Marcu, 2007a) show that, in phrase-based translation, improvements in AER or f-measure do not necessarily correlate with improvements in BLEU score."
W08-0306	D07-1006	o	"They propose two modifications to f-measure: varying the precision/recall tradeoff, and fully-connecting the alignment links before computing f-measure.11 Weighted Fully-Connected F-Measure Given a hypothesized set of alignment links H and a goldstandard set of alignment links G, we define H+ = fullyConnect(H) and G+ = fullyConnect(G), and then compute: f-measure(H+) = 1 precision(H+) + 1 recall(H+) For phrase-based Chinese-English and ArabicEnglish translation tasks, (Fraser and Marcu, 2007a) obtain the closest correlation between weighted fully-connected alignment f-measure and BLEU score using =0.5 and =0.1, respectively."

D08-1039	D07-1007	p	"In Carpuat and Wu (2007), anotherstate-of-the-artWSDengine(acombination of naive Bayes, maximum entropy, boosting and Kernel PCA models) is used to dynamically determine the score of a phrase pair under consideration and, thus, let the phrase selection adapt to the context of the sentence."
D08-1105	D07-1007	p	"WSD is one of the fundamental problems in natural language processing and is important for applications such as machine translation (MT) (Chan et al., 2007a; Carpuat and Wu, 2007), information retrieval (IR), etc. WSD is typically viewed as a classification problem where each ambiguous word is assigned a sense label (from a pre-defined sense inventory) during the disambiguation process."
D09-1022	D07-1007	o	"Another WSD approach incorporating context-dependent phrasal translation lexicons is given in (Carpuat and Wu, 2007) and has been evaluated on several translation tasks."
D09-1022	D07-1007	o	"Second, instead of disambiguating phrase senses as in (Carpuat and Wu, 2007), we model word selection independently of the phrases used in the MT models."

I08-1073	D07-1007	p	"There has been considerable skepticism over whether WSD will actually improve performance of applications, but we are now starting to see improvement in performance due to WSD in cross-lingual information retrieval (Clough and Stevenson, 2004; Vossen et al., 2006) and machine translation (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Chan et al., 2007) and we hope that other applications such as question-answering, text simplication and summarisation might also benet as WSD methods improve."

W09-2404	D07-1007	p	"In Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), recent work shows that WSD helps translation quality when the WSD system directly uses translation candidates as sense inventories (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Chan et al., 2007; Gimenez and M`arquez, 2007)."
W09-2404	D07-1007	o	"Even the recent generation of SMT models that explicitly use WSD modeling to perform lexical choice rely on sentence context rather than wider document context and translate sentences in isolation (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Chan et al., 2007; Gimenez and M`arquez, 2007; Stroppa et al., 2007; Specia et al., 2008)."

C08-1042	D07-1031	o	"There is evidence that this leads to better performance on some part-of-speech induction metrics (Johnson, 2007; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007)."
C08-1042	D07-1031	o	"Johnson (2007) evaluates both estimation techniques on the Bayesian bitag model; Goldwater and Griffiths (2007) emphasize the advantage in the MCMC approach of integrating out the HMM parameters in a tritag model, yielding a tagging supported by many different parameter settings."
C08-1042	D07-1031	o	"Following the setup in Johnson (2007), we initialize the transition and emission distributions to be uniform with a small amount of noise, and run EM and VB for 1000 iterations."
C08-1042	D07-1031	o	"In our VB experiments we set i = j = 0.1,i  {1,,|T|},j  {1,,|V |}, which yielded the best performance on most reported metrics in Johnson (2007)."
C08-1042	D07-1031	o	"We use maximum marginal decoding, which Johnson (2007) reports performs better than Viterbi decoding."
C08-1042	D07-1031	o	"One option is what Johnson (2007) calls many-to-one (M-to-1) accuracy, in which each induced tag is labeled with its most frequent gold tag."
C08-1042	D07-1031	o	"In cases where the number of gold tags is different than the number of induced tags, some must necessarily remain unassigned (Johnson, 2007)."
D08-1036	D07-1031	o	"Finally, following Haghighi and Klein (2006) and Johnson (2007) we can instead insist that at most one HMM state can be mapped to any part-of-speech tag."
D08-1036	D07-1031	o	The studies presented by Goldwater and Griffiths (2007) and Johnson (2007) differed in the number of states that they used.
D08-1036	D07-1031	o	"Goldwater and Griffiths (2007) evaluated against the reduced tag set of 17 tags developed by Smith and Eisner (2005), while Johnson (2007) evaluated against the full Penn Treebank tag set."

D08-1036	D07-1031	o	"Expectation Maximization does surprisingly well on larger data sets and is competitive with the Bayesian estimators at least in terms of cross-validation accuracy, confirming the results reported by Johnson (2007)."

D08-1036	D07-1031	o	"Johnson (2007) compared two Bayesian inference algorithms, Variational Bayes and what we call here a point-wise collapsed Gibbs sampler, and found that Variational Bayes produced the best solution, and that the Gibbs sampler was extremely slow to converge and produced a worse solution than EM."
D08-1036	D07-1031	o	The samplers that Goldwater and Griffiths (2007) and Johnson (2007) describe are pointwise collapsed Gibbs samplers.

D09-1071	D07-1031	o	Johnson (2007) and Gao & Johnson (2008) assume that words are generated by a hidden Markov model and find that the resulting states strongly correlate with POS tags.
D09-1071	D07-1031	o	The fact that different authors use different versions of the same gold standard to evaluate similar experiments (e.g. Goldwater & Griffiths (2007) versus Johnson (2007)) supports this claim.
D09-1071	D07-1031	o	"Johnson (2007) reports results for different numbers of hidden states but it is unclear how to make this choice a priori, while Goldwater & Griffiths (2007) leave this question as future work."
D09-1071	D07-1031	p	"Given the parameters{pi0,pi,,K}of the HMM, the joint distribution over hidden states s and observationsy can be written (with s0 = 0): p(s,y|pi0,pi,,K) = Tproductdisplay t=1 p(st|st1)p(yt|st) As Johnson (2007) clearly explained, training the HMM with EM leads to poor results in PoS tagging."

E09-1042	D07-1031	o	"Nevertheless, EM sometimes fails to find good parameter values.2 The reason is that EM tries to assign roughly the same number of word tokens to each of the hidden states (Johnson, 2007)."
N09-1009	D07-1031	o	"There has been an increased interest recently in employing Bayesian modeling for probabilistic grammars in different settings, ranging from putting priors over grammar probabilities (Johnson et al., 2007) to putting non-parametric priors over derivations (Johnson et al., 2006) to learning the set of states in a grammar (Finkel et al., 2007; Liang et al., 2007)."

N09-1069	D07-1031	o	"For instance, on unsupervised part-ofspeech tagging, EM requires over 100 iterations to reach its peak performance on the Wall-Street Journal (Johnson, 2007)."
P08-1012	D07-1031	n	"Unlike Johnson (2007), who found optimal performance when  was approximately 104, we observed monotonic increases in performance as  dropped."
P08-1012	D07-1031	o	3 Variational Bayes for ITG Goldwater and Griffiths (2007) and Johnson (2007) show that modifying an HMM to include a sparse prior over its parameters and using Bayesian estimation leads to improved accuracy for unsupervised part-of-speech tagging.
P08-1012	D07-1031	o	"However, in experiments in unsupervised POS tag learning using HMM structured models, Johnson (2007) shows that VB is more effective than Gibbs sampling in approaching distributions that agree with the Zipfs law, which is prominent in natural languages."
P08-1012	D07-1031	o	"As pointed out by Johnson (2007), in effect this expression adds to c a small value that asymptotically approaches  0.5 as c approaches , and 0 as c approaches 0."

P09-1056	D07-1031	o	"HMMs have been used many times for POS tagging and chunking, in supervised, semisupervised, and in unsupervised settings (Banko and Moore, 2004; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Johnson, 2007; Zhou, 2004)."
P09-1057	D07-1031	o	"6 Smaller Tagset and Incomplete Dictionaries Previously, researchers working on this task have also reported results for unsupervised tagging with a smaller tagset (Smith and Eisner, 2005; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Toutanova and Johnson, 2008; Goldberg et al., 2008)."
P09-1057	D07-1031	o	"The overall POS tag distribution learnt by EM is relatively uniform, as noted by Johnson (2007), and it tends to assign equal number of tokens to each tag label whereas the real tag distribution is highly skewed."
E09-1048	D07-1047	p	"This is also the main reason why most summarization systems applied to news articles do not outperform a simple baseline that just uses the first 100 words of an article (Svore et al., 2007; Nenkova, 2005)."

J03-1002	J93-2003	o	"An analysis of the alignments shows that smoothing the fertility probabilities significantly reduces the frequently occurring problem of rare words forming garbage collectors in that they tend to align with too many words in the other language (Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, Goldsmith, et al. 1993)."
J03-1005	J93-2003	o	The fertility for the null word is treated specially (for details see Brown et al. [1993]).
J03-1005	J93-2003	o	For placing the head the center function center(i) (Brown et al. [1993] uses the notation circledot i ) is used: the average position of the source words with which the target word e i1 is aligned.
J04-2003	J93-2003	o	"Many existing systems for statistical machine translation (Garca-Varea and Casacuberta 2001; Germann et al. 2001; Nieen et al. 1998; Och, Tillmann, and Ney 1999) implement models presented by Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993): The correspondence between the words in the source and the target strings is described by alignments that assign target word positions to each source word position."
J04-2003	J93-2003	o	"The translation models they presented in various papers between 1988 and 1993 (Brown et al. 1988; Brown et al. 1990; Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer 1993) are commonly referred to as IBM models 15, based on the numbering in Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993)."
J04-2004	J93-2003	o	"These results were achieved using the statistical alignments provided by model 5 (Brown et al. 1993; Och and Ney 2000) and smoothed 11-grams and 6-grams, respectively."
J04-2004	J93-2003	o	In the following section we show how this drawback can be overcome using statistical alignments (Brown et al. 1993).
J04-4002	J93-2003	p	"Yet the modeling, training, and search methods have also improved since the field of statistical machine translation was pioneered by IBM in the late 1980s and early 1990s (Brown et al. 1990; Brown et al. 1993; Berger et al. 1994)."
J04-4002	J93-2003	o	"As an alternative to the often used sourcechannel approach (Brown et al. 1993), we directly model the posterior probability Pr(e I 1 | f J 1 ) (Och and Ney 2002)."
J05-3002	J93-2003	o	Knight and Marcu (2000) treat reduction as a translation process using a noisychannel model (Brown et al. 1993).
J05-4003	J93-2003	o	One such model is the IBM Model 1 (Brown et al. 1993).
J05-4004	J93-2003	o	"We compare against several competing systems, the first of which is based on the original IBM Model 4 for machine translation (Brown et al. 1993) and the HMM machine translation alignment model (Vogel, Ney, and Tillmann 1996) as implemented in the GIZA++ package (Och and Ney 2003)."
J05-4004	J93-2003	n	"Our system outperforms competing approaches, including the standard machine translation alignment models (Brown et al. 1993; Vogel, Ney, and Tillmann 1996) and the state-of-the-art Cut and Paste summary alignment technique (Jing 2002)."
J05-4004	J93-2003	o	"One obvious first approach would be to run a simpler model for the first iteration (for example, Model 1 from machine translation (Brown et al. 1993), which tends to be very recall oriented) and use this to see subsequent iterations of the more complex model."
J05-4004	J93-2003	o	"In the context of headline generation, simple statistical models are used for aligning documents and headlines (Banko, Mittal, and Witbrock 2000; Berger and Mittal 2000; Schwartz, Zajic, and Dorr 2002), based on IBM Model 1 (Brown et al. 1993)."
J06-4004	J93-2003	o	"For these first SMT systems, translation-model probabilities at the sentence level were approximated from word-based translation models that were trained by using bilingual corpora (Brown et al. 1993)."
J06-4004	J93-2003	o	This feature is implemented by using the IBM-1 lexical parameters (Brown et al. 1993; Och et al. 2004).
J06-4004	J93-2003	o	"More specifically, the latter system uses the IBM-1 lexical parameters (Brown et al. 1993) for computing the translation probabilities of two possible new tuples: the one resulting when the null-aligned-word is attached to Table 6 Evaluation results for experiments on n-gram size incidence."
J06-4004	J93-2003	p	"According to our experience, the best performance is achieved when the union of the source-to-target and target-to-source alignment sets (IBM models; Brown et al. [1993]) is used for tuple extraction (some experimental results regarding this issue are presented in Section 4.2.2)."
J06-4004	J93-2003	o	"The first SMT systems were developed in the early nineties (Brown et al. 1990, 1993)."
J07-1003	J93-2003	o	"Therefore, we determine the maximal translation probability of the target word e over the source sentence words: p ibm1 (e|f J 1 ) = max j=0,,J p(e|f j ) (18) where f 0 is the empty source word (Brown et al. 1993)."
J07-2003	J93-2003	o	The basic phrase-based model is an instance of the noisy-channel approach (Brown et al. 1993).
J07-3002	J93-2003	p	Introduction Automatic word alignment (Brown et al. 1993) is a vital component of all statistical machine translation (SMT) approaches.
J09-1002	J93-2003	o	"Different approaches have been proposed for modeling Pr(s,a|t) in Equation (8): Zero-order models such as model 1, model 2,andmodel 3 (Brown et al. 1993) and the rstorder models such as model 4, model 5 (Brown et al. 1993), hidden Markov model (Ney et al. 2000), and model 6 (Och and Ney 2003)."
J09-1002	J93-2003	o	"Note that the translation direction is inverted from what would be normally expected; correspondingly the models built around this equation are often called invertedtranslationmodels (Brown et al. 1990, 1993)."
J93-1001	J93-2003	o	"Four alternatives are proposed in these special issues: (1) Brent (1993), (2) Briscoe and Carroll (this issue), (3) Hindle and Rooth (this issue), and (4) Weischedel et al."
J93-1001	J93-2003	o	"This is a particularly exciting area in computational linguistics as evidenced by the large number of contributions in these special issues: Biber (1993), Brent (1993), Hindle and Rooth (this issue), Pustejovsky et al."
J96-1001	J93-2003	o	"Related Work The recent availability of large amounts of bilingual data has attracted interest in several areas, including sentence alignment (Gale and Church 1991b; Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991; Simard, Foster and Isabelle 1992; Gale and Church 1993; Chen 1993), word alignment (Gale and Church 1991a; Brown et al. 1993; Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993; Fung and McKeown 1994; Fung 1995b), alignment of groups of words (Smadja 1992; Kupiec 1993; van der Eijk 1993), and statistical translation (Brown et al. 1993)."
J97-2004	J93-2003	o	Notice that most in-context and dictionary translations of source words are bounded within the same category in a typical thesaurus such as the LLOCE (McArthur 1992) and CILIN (Mei et al. 1993).
J97-2004	J93-2003	o	The above observations can be stated formally from the perspective of Brown et al.'s (1993) Model 2.
J97-2004	J93-2003	n	"In terms of alignment, this wordnumber difference means that multiword connections must be considered, a task which 334 Sue J. Ker and Jason S. Chang Word Alignment is beyond the reach of methods proposed in recent alignment works based on Brown et al.'s (1993) Model 1 and 2."
J97-3002	J93-2003	o	"Parallel bilingual corpora have been shown to provide a rich source of constraints for statistical analysis (Brown et al. 1990; Gale and Church 1991; Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992; Church 1993; Brown et al. 1993; Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993; Department of Computer Science, University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong."
J97-3002	J93-2003	o	"The usual Chinese NLP architecture first preprocesses input text through a word segmentation module (Chiang et al. 1992; Lin, Chiang, and Su 1992, 1993; Chang and Chen 1993; Wu and Tseng 1993; Sproat et al. 1994; Wu and Fung 1994), but, clearly, bilingual parsing will be hampered by any errors arising from segmentation ambiguities that could not be resolved in the isolated monolingual context because even if the Chinese segmentation is acceptable monolingually, it may not agree with the words present in the English sentence."
J97-3002	J93-2003	o	The later IBM models are formulated to prefer collocations (Brown et al. 1993).
J98-4003	J93-2003	o	"(p. 18) Whether this is a useful perspective for machine translation is debatable (Brown et al. 1993; Knoblock 1996)--however, it is a dead-on description of transliteration."
J99-1003	J93-2003	o	Then they adapted Brown et al.'s (1993) statistical translation Model 2 to work with this model of cooccurrence.
J99-1003	J93-2003	o	"A limitation of Church's method, and therefore also of Dagan, Church, and Gale's method, is that orthographic cognates exist only among languages with similar alphabets (Church et al. 1993)."
J99-1003	J93-2003	o	"Although the above statement was made about translation problems faced by human translators, recent research (Brown et al. 1993; Melamed 1996b) suggests that it also applies to problems in machine translation."
J99-1003	J93-2003	o	"For example, bilingual lexicographers can use bitexts to discover new cross-language lexicalization patterns (Catizone, Russell, and Warwick 1993; Gale and Church 1991b); students of foreign languages can use one half of a bitext to practice their reading skills, referring to the other half for translation when they get stuck (Nerbonne et al. 1997)."
N03-1010	J93-2003	o	"1 Introduction Most of the current work in statistical machine translation builds on word replacement models developed at IBM in the early 1990s (Brown et al. , 1990, 1993; Berger et al. , 1994, 1996)."

N03-4001	J93-2003	n	"By segmenting words into morphemes, we can improve the performance of natural language systems including machine translation (Brown et al. 1993) and information retrieval (Franz, M. and McCarley, S. 2002)."
N04-1008	J93-2003	o	"For comparison purposes, we consider two different algorithms for our AnswerExtraction module: one that does not bridge the lexical chasm, based on N-gram cooccurrences between the question terms and the answer terms; and one that attempts to bridge the lexical chasm using Statistical Machine Translation inspired techniques (Brown et al. , 1993) in order to find the best answer for a given question."
N04-1008	J93-2003	o	"The mapping of answer terms to question terms is modeled using Black et al.s (1993) simplest model, called IBM Model 1."
N04-1021	J93-2003	o	"We are given a source (Chinese) sentence f = fJ1 = f1,,fj,,fJ, which is to be translated into a target (English) sentence e = eI1 = e1,,ei,,eI Among all possible target sentences, we will choose the sentence with the highest probability: eI1 = argmax eI1 {Pr(eI1|fJ1 )} (1) As an alternative to the often used source-channel approach (Brown et al. , 1993), we directly model the posterior probability Pr(eI1|fJ1 ) (Och and Ney, 2002) using a log-linear combination of feature functions."

On the other hand, though experimental results are quite good, we find them particularly relevant for pointing out directions to follow for further improvement of the Grammar Association technique."

On the basis of this evidence, we expect the system to also learn from sentence pair (S1, T1) that a in language S means the same thing as y in language T. Unfortunately, if one works with translation models that do not allow Target words to be aligned to more than one Source word  as it is the case in the IBM models (Brown et al. , 1993)  it is impossible to learn that the phrase b c in language S means the same thing as word x in language T.

find out the raterannotator agreement among ~ts lexicographers taggrog the word senses (Kllgamff, 1998c, Kllgarnff, 1998a, Kflgarrlff, 1998b) 2 A Case Study In this-paper, we examine the ~ssue of raterannotator agreement by comparing the agreement rate of human annotators on a large sense-tagged corpus of more than 30,000 instances of the most frequently occurring nouns and verbs of Enghsh This corpus is the intersection of the WORDNET Semcor corpus (Miller et al, 1993) and the DSO corpus (Ng and Lee, 1996, Ng, 1997), which has been independently tagged wlth the refined senses of WORDNET by two separate groups of human annotators The Semcor corpus us a subset of the Brown corpus tagged with ~VoRDNET senses, and consists of more than 670,000 words from 352 text files Sense taggmg was done on the content words (nouns, ~erbs, adjectives and adverbs) m this subset The DSO corpus consists of sentences drawn from the Brown corpus and the Wall Street Journal For each word w from a hst of 191 frequently occurring words of Enghsh (121 nouns and 70 verbs), sentences containing w (m singular or plural form, and m its various reflectional verb form) are selected and each word occurrence w ~s tagged w~th a sense from WoRDNET There ~s a total of about 192,800 sentences in the DSO corpus m which one word occurrence has been sense-tagged m each sentence The intersection of the Semcor corpus and the DSO corpus thus consists of Brown corpus sentences m which a word occurrence w is sense-tagged m each sentence, where w Is one of.the 191 frequently oc-,currmg English nouns or verbs Since this common pomon has been sense-tagged by two independent groups of human annotators, ~t serves as our data set for investigating inter-annotator agreement in this paper 3 Sentence Matching To determine the extent of inter-annotator agreement, the first step ~s to match each sentence m Semcor to its corresponding counterpart In the DSO corpus This step ~s comphcated by the following factors 1 Although the intersected portion of both corpora came from Brown corpus, they adopted different tokemzatmn convention, and segmentartan into sentences differed sometimes 2 The latest versmn of Semcor makes use of the senses from WORDNET 1 6, whereas the senses used m the DSO corpus were from WoRDNET 15 1 To match the sentences, we first converted the senses m the DSO corpus to those of WORDNET 1 6 We ignored all sentences m the DSO corpus m which a word is tagged with sense 0 or -1 (A word is tagged with sense 0 or -1 ff none of the given senses m WoRDNFT applies ) 4, sentence from Semcor is considered to match one from the DSO corpus ff both sentences are exactl) ldent~cal or ff the~ differ only m the pre~ence or absence of the characters "" (permd) or -' (hyphen) For each remaining Semcor sentence, taking into account word ordering, ff 75% or more of the words m the sentence match those in a DSO corpus sentence, then a potential match ~s recorded These i -kctua\[ly, the WORD~q'ET senses used m the DSO corpus were from a shght variant of the official WORDNE'I 1 5 release Th~s ssas brought to our attention after the pubhc release of the DSO corpus potential matches are then manually verffied to ensure that they are true matches and to ~eed out any false matches Using this method of matching, a total of 13,188 sentence-palrs contasnmg nouns and 17,127 sentence-pa~rs containing verbs are found to match from both corpora, ymldmg 30,315 sentences which form the intersected corpus used m our present study 4 The Kappa Statistic Suppose there are N sentences m our corpus where each sentence contains the word w Assume that w has M senses Let 4 be the number of sentences which are assigned identical sense b~ two human annotators Then a simple measure to quantify the agreement rate between two human annotators Is Pc, where Pc, = A/N The drawback of this simple measure is that it does not take into account chance agreement between two annotators The Kappa statistic a (Cohen, 1960) is a better measure of rater-annotator agreement which takes into account the effect of chance agreement It has been used recently w~thm computatmnal hngu~stlcs to measure raterannotator agreement (Bruce and Wmbe, 1998, Carletta, 1996, Veroms, 1998) Let Cj be the sum of the number of sentences which have been assigned sense 3 by annotator 1 and the number of sentences whmh have been assigned sense 3 by annotator 2 Then P~-P~ 1-P~ where M j=l and Pe measures the chance agreement between two annotators A Kappa ~alue of 0 indicates that the agreement is purely due to chance agreement, whereas a Kappa ~alue of 1 indicates perfect agreement A Kappa ~alue of 0 8 and above is considered as mdmatmg good agreement (Carletta, 1996) Table 1

the rater-annotator agreement on the intersected corpus is not high, we would like to find out how the agreement rate would be affected if different sense classes were in use In this section, we present a greedy search algorithm that can automatmalb derive coarser sense classes based on the sense tags assigned by two human annotators The resulting derived coarse sense classes achmve a higher agreement rate but we still maintain as many of the original sense classes as possible The algorithm is given m Figure 1 The algorithm operates on a set of sentences where each sentence contains an occurrence of the word w whmh has been sense-tagged by two human annotators At each Iteration of the algorithm, tt finds the pair of sense classes Ct and Cj such that merging these two sense classes results in the highest t~ value for the resulting merged group of sense classes It then proceeds to merge Cz and C~ Thin process Is repeated until the ~ value reaches a satisfactory value ~,~t,~, which we set as 0 8 Note that this algorithm is also applicable to deriving any coarser set of classes from a refined set for any NLP tasks in which prior human agreement rate may not be high enough Such NLP tasks could be discourse tagging, speech-act categorization, etc 6 Results For each word w from the list of 121 nouns and 70 verbs, ~e applied the greedy search algorithm to each set of sentences in the intersected corpus contaming w For a subset of 95 words (53 nouns and 42 verbs), the algorithm was able to derive a coarser set of 2 or more senses for each of these 95 words such that the resulting Kappa ~alue reaches 0 8 or higher For the other 96 words, m order for the Kappa value to reach 0 8 or higher, the algorithm collapses all senses of the ~ord to a single (trivial) class Table 2 and 3 summarizes the results for the set of 53 nouns and 42 ~erbs, respectively Table 2 md~cates that before the collapse of sense classes, these 53 nouns have an average of 7 6 senses per noun There is a total of 5,339 sentences in the intersected corpus containing these nouns, of which 3,387 sentences were assigned the same sense by the two groups of human annotators The average Kappa statistic (computed as a simple average of the Kappa statistic of ~he mdlwdual nouns) is 0 463 After the collapse of sense classes by the greedy search algorithm, the average number of senses per noun for these 53 nouns drops to 40 Howe~er, the number of sentences which have been asmgned the same coarse sense by the annotators increases to 5,033 That is, about 94 3% of the sentences have been assigned the same coarse sense, and that the average Kappa statistic has improved to 0 862, mgmfymg high rater-annotator agreement on the derived coarse senses Table3 gl~es the analogous figures for the 42 verbs, agmn mdmatmg that high agreement is achieved on the coarse sense classes den~ed for verbs 7 Discussion Our findings on rater-annotator agreement for word sense tagging indicate that for average language users, it is quite dl~cult to achieve high agreement when they are asked to assign refned sense tags (such as those found in WORDNET) given only the scanty definition entries m the WORDNET dlctionary and a few or no example sentences for the usage of each word sense Thin observation agrees wlth that obtmned m a recent study done by (Veroms, 1998), where the agreement on sense-tagging by naive users was also not hlgh Thus It appears that an average language user is able to process language wlthout needing to perform the task of dlsamblguatmg word sense to a very fine-grained resolutmn as formulated m a tradltlonal dmtlonary In contrast, expert lexicographers tagged the ~ ord sense in the sentences used m the SENSEVAL exerclse, where high rater-annotator agreement was reported There are also fuller dlctlonary entries m the HECTOR dlctlonary used and more e<amples showing the usage of each word sense m HECTOR These factors are likely to have contributed to the difference in rater-annotator agreement observed m the three studies conducted We also examined the coarse sense classes derived by the greedy search algorithm Vv'e found some interesting groupings of coarse senses for nouns which ~e hst in Table 4 From Table 4, it is apparent that the greedy search algorithm can derive interesting groupings of word senses that correspond to human mtmtwe judgment of sense graz}.ulanty It Is clear that some of the disagreement between the two groups of human annotators can be attributed solely to the overly refined senses of WoRDNET As an example, there is a total Ii loop: let Ct,, C M denote the current M sense classes ~* +--oo for all z,3 such that 1 <, < 3 < M let C\[,,C~w_ 1 denote the resulting M 1 sense classes by mergmg C,

A00-1012	J96-2004	o	"Carletta mentions this problem, asking what the difference would be if the kappa statistic were computed across ""clause boundaries, transcribed word boundaries, and transcribed phoneme boundaries"" (Carletta, 1996, p. 252) rather than the sentence boundaries she suggested."

A97-1050	J96-2004	o	"4.5 Consistency of Annotations In order to assess the consistency of annotation, we follow Carletta (1996) in using Cohen's ~, a chancecorrected measure of inter-rater agreement."

C04-1020	J96-2004	o	"In order to determine inter-annotator agreement for the database of annotated texts, we computed kappa statistics (Carletta, 1996)."
C04-1034	J96-2004	o	"The reliability for the two annotation tasks (-statistics (Carletta, 1996)) was of 0.94 and 0.90 respectively."
C04-1035	J96-2004	o	"[KD1, 2371] 2.3 Reliability To evaluate the reliability of the annotation, we use the kappa coe cient (K) (Carletta, 1996), which measures pairwise agreement between a set of coders making category judgements, correcting for expected chance agreement."
C04-1128	J96-2004	o	"The kappa statistic (Carletta, 1996) for identifying question segments is 0.68, and for linking question and answer segments given a question segment is 0.81."
C04-1161	J96-2004	o	Carletta (1996) says that 0.67 a10a14a11a15a10 0.8 allows just tentative conclusions to be drawn.
C08-1109	J96-2004	o	"While the need for annotation by multiple raters has been well established in NLP tasks (Carletta, 1996), most previous work in error detection has surprisingly relied on only one rater to either create an annotated corpus of learner errors, or to check the systems output."
C96-1059	J96-2004	o	"To support a more rigorous analysis, however, wc have followed Carletta's suggestion (1996) of using the K coettMcnt (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) as a measure of coder agreement."
D08-1021	J96-2004	o	"We measured inter-annotator agreement with the Kappa statistic (Carletta, 1996) using the 1,391 items that two annotators scored in common."
D09-1150	J96-2004	o	"3.1 Agreement for Emotion Classes The kappa coefficient of agreement is a statistic adopted by the Computational Linguistics community as a standard measure for this purpose (Carletta, 1996)."
D09-1155	J96-2004	p	"As agreement measure we choose the Kappa coefficient  (Fleiss, 1971; Siegel and Castellan, 1988), the agreement measure predominantly used in natural language processing research (Carletta, 1996)."
E06-1007	J96-2004	o	"We then examined the inter-annotator reliability of the annotation by calculating the  score (Carletta, 1996)."
E99-1006	J96-2004	o	"After each step the annotations were compared using the ~ statistic as reliability measure for all classification tasks (Carletta, 1996)."
E99-1015	J96-2004	o	"Kappa is a better measurement of agreement than raw percentage agreement (Carletta, 1996) because it factors out the level of agreement which would be reached by random annotators using the same distribution of categories as the real coders."
H05-1031	J96-2004	o	5.2 Results on the Newsblaster data We measured how well the models trained on DUC data perform with current news labeled using human 4http://newsblaster.cs.columbia.edu 5a20 (kappa) is a measure of inter-annotator agreement over and above what might be expected by pure chance (See Carletta (1996) for discussion of its use in NLP).a20a22a21a24a23 if there is perfect agreement between annotators anda20a25a21a27a26 if the annotators agree only as much as you would expect by chance.
H05-1115	J96-2004	o	"Once an acceptable rate of interjudge agreement was verified on the first nine clusters (Kappa (Carletta, 1996) of 0.68), the remaining 11 clusters were annotated by one judge each."
J00-3003	J96-2004	o	"As argued in Carletta (1996), Kappa values of 0.8 or higher are desirable for detecting associations between several coded variables; we were thus satisfied with the level of agreement achieved."
J00-4003	J96-2004	o	Agreement among annotators was measured using the K statistic (Siegel and Castellan 1988; Carletta 1996).
J01-3003	J96-2004	o	"Carletta (1996) cites the convention from the domain of content analysis indicating that .67 K K < .8 indicates marginal agreement, while K > .8 is an indication of good agreement."
J02-3004	J96-2004	p	"Although the Kappa coefficient has a number of advantages over percentage agreement (e.g. , it takes into account the expected chance interrater agreement; see Carletta (1996) for details), we also report percentage agreement as it allows us to compare straightforwardly the human performance and the automatic methods described below, whose performance will also be reported in terms of percentage agreement."
J02-4001	J96-2004	o	"Other commonly used measures include kappa (Carletta 1996) and relative utility (Radev, Jing, and Budzikowska 2000), both of which take into account the performance of a summarizer that randomly picks passages from the original document to produce an extract."
J02-4002	J96-2004	o	"421 Teufel and Moens Summarizing Scientific Articles We use the kappa coefficient K (Siegel and Castellan 1988) to measure stability and reproducibility, following Carletta (1996)."
J03-1004	J96-2004	o	"As Carletta (1996) notes, many tasks in computational linguistics are simply more difficult than the content analysis classifications addressed by Krippendorff, and according to Fleiss (1981), kappa values between .4 and .75 indicate fair to good agreement anyhow."
J04-1005	J96-2004	o	Carletta (1996) deserves the credit for bringing  to the attention of computational linguists.
J04-3003	J96-2004	o	"One of our goals was to use for this study only information that could be annotated reliably (Passonneau and Litman 1993; Carletta 1996), as we believe this will make our results easier to replicate."
J04-3003	J96-2004	o	"The agreement on identifying the boundaries of units, using the kappa statistic discussed in Carletta (1996), was  = .9 (for two annotators and 500 units); the agreement on features (two annotators and at least 200 units) was as follows: utype:  = .76; verbed:  = .9; nite:  = .81."
J05-2005	J96-2004	o	"In order to determine interannotator agreement for step 2 of the coding procedure for the database of annotated texts, we calculated kappa statistics (Carletta 1996)."
J05-3001	J96-2004	o	"For example, the coding manual for the Switchboard DAMSL dialogue act annotation scheme (Jurafsky, Shriberg, and Biasca 1997, page 2) states that kappa is used to assess labelling accuracy, and Di Eugenio and Glass (2004) relate reliability to the objectivity of decisions, whereas Carletta (1996) regards reliability as the degree to which we understand the judgments that annotators are asked to make."
J05-3001	J96-2004	o	"This is an unsuitable measure for inferring reliability, and it was the use of this measure that prompted Carletta (1996) to recommend chance-corrected measures."
J05-3001	J96-2004	p	"Since Jean Carletta (1996) exposed computational linguists to the desirability of using chance-corrected agreement statistics to infer the reliability of data generated by applying coding schemes, there has been a general acceptance of their use within the field."
J05-3001	J96-2004	o	The prevalent use of this criterion despite repeated advice that it is unlikely to be suitable for all studies (Carletta 1996; Di Eugenio and Glass 2004; Krippendorff 2004a) is probably due to a desire for a simple system that can be easily applied to a scheme.
J07-1002	J96-2004	o	G-Theory and Agreement Indices Two well-known measures for capturing the quality of manual annotations are agreement percentages and the kappa statistic (Cohen 1960; Carletta 1996; Eugenio and Glass 2004).
J08-3001	J96-2004	o	"He uses a specic reliability statistic, , for his measurements, but Carletta (1996) implicitly assumes kappa-like metrics are similar enough in practice for the rule of thumb to apply to them as well.A detailed discussion on the differences and similarities of these, and other, measures is provided by Krippendorff (2004); in this article we will use Cohens  (1960) to investigate the value of the 0.8 reliability cut-off for computational linguistics."
J97-1002	J96-2004	o	"4.2 Interpreting reliability results It has been argued elsewhere (Carletta 1996) that since the amount of agreement one would expect by chance depends on the number and relative frequencies of the categories under test, reliability for category classifications should be measured using the kappa coefficient."
J97-1003	J96-2004	o	6.1 Reader Judgments There is a growing concern surrounding issues of intercoder reliability when using human judgments to evaluate discourse-processing algorithms (Carletta 1996; Condon and Cech 1995).
J97-1003	J96-2004	o	Proposals have recently been made for protocols for the collection of human discourse segmentation data (Nakatani et al. 1995) and for how to evaluate the validity of judgments so obtained (Carletta 1996; Isard and Carletta 1995; Ros6 1995; Passonneau and Litman 1993; Litman and Passonneau 1995).
J97-1003	J96-2004	o	Carletta (1996) and Ros6 (1995) point out the importance of taking into account the expected chance agreement among judges when computing whether or not judges agree significantly.
J97-1003	J96-2004	o	"According to Carletta (1996), K measures pairwise agreement among a set of coders making category judgments, correcting for expected chance agreement as follows: KP(A) -P(E) 1 -P(E) where P(A) is the proportion of times that the coders agree and P(E) is the proportion of times that they would be expected to agree by chance."
J97-1003	J96-2004	o	"Carletta (1996) also states that in the behavioral sciences, K > .8 signals good replicability, and .67 < K < .8 allows tentative conclusions to be drawn."
J97-1005	J96-2004	o	"Reliability metrics (Krippendorff 1980; Carletta 1996) are designed to give a robust measure of how well distinct sets of data agree with, or replicate, one another."
J97-1005	J96-2004	o	"In Hirschberg and Nakatani (1996), average reliability (measured using the kappa coefficient discussed in Carletta \[1996\]) of segmentinitial labels among 3 coders on 9 monologues produced by the same speaker, labeled using text and speech, is.8 or above for both read and spontaneous speech; values of at least .8 are typically viewed as representing high reliability (see Section 3.2)."
J98-2001	J96-2004	o	Our study is also different from these previous ones in that measuring the agreement among annotators became an issue (Carletta 1996).
J98-2001	J96-2004	o	"Idiom 0 0 1 1 0 2 V. Doubt 3 0 4 0 0 7 Total A 294 160 546 39 1 1,040 In order to measure the agreement in a more precise way, we used the Kappa statistic (Siegel and Castellan 1988), recently proposed by Carletta as a measure of agreement for discourse analysis (Carletta 1996)."
J98-2001	J96-2004	o	"And indeed, the agreement figures went up from K = 0.63 to K = 0.68 (ignoring doubts) when we did so, i.e., within the ""tentative"" margins of agreement according to Carletta (1996) (0.68 <_ x < 0.8)."
N01-1010	J96-2004	o	"11 This low agreement ratio is also re ected in a measure called the  statistic (Carletta, 1996;; Bruce and Wiebe, 1998;; Ng et al. , 1999)."
N01-1010	J96-2004	o	"Normally,   :8 is considered a good agreement (Carletta, 1996)."
N01-1010	J96-2004	o	"The results are quite promising: our extraction method discovered 89% of the WordNet cousins, and the sense partitions in our lexicon yielded better  values (Carletta, 1996) than arbitrary sense groupings on the agreement data."
N03-1012	J96-2004	o	"The resulting Kappa statistics (Carletta, 1996) over the annotated data yields a0a2a1 a3a5a4a7a6, which seems to indicate that human annotators can reliably distinguish between coherent samples (as in Example (1a)) and incoherent ones (as in Example (1b))."
N04-1026	J96-2004	o	"The two annotators agreed on the annotations of 385/453 turns, achieving 84.99% agreement, with Kappa = 0.68.2 This inter-annotator agreement exceeds that of prior studies of emotion annotation in naturally occurring speech 2a3a5a4a7a6a8a6a9a4a11a10a13a12a15a14a17a16a19a18a21a20a22a12a23a14a25a24a26a18 a27 a20a22a12a23a14a25a24a26a18 (Carletta, 1996)."
N06-2040	J96-2004	o	"The kappa (Carletta, 1996) obtained on this feature was 0.93."

P00-1051	J96-2004	o	"One of our goals was to use for our study only information that could be annotated reliably (Passonneau and Litman, 1993; Carletta, 1996), as we believe this will make our results easier to replicate."
P00-1051	J96-2004	o	"The agreement on identifying the boundaries of units, using the AK statistic discussed in (Carletta, 1996), was AK BP BMBL (for two annotators and 500 units); the agreement on features(2 annotators and at least 200 units) was follows: Attribute AK Value utype .76 verbed .9 finite .81 subject .86 NPs Our instructions for identifying NP markables derive from those proposed in the MATE project scheme for annotating anaphoric relations (Poesio et al. , 1999)."
P01-1032	J96-2004	o	"On the one hand, even the higher of the kappa coefficients mentioned above is significantly lower than the standard suggested for good reliability (a124a126a125a128a127a130a129 ) or even the level where tentative conclusions may be drawn (a127a130a131a133a132a135a134a72a124 a134 a127a130a129 ) (Carletta, 1996), (Krippendorff, 1980)."

P01-1051	J96-2004	o	"Analyze resulting findings to determine a progression of competence In (Michaud et al. , 2001) we discuss the initial steps we took in this process, including the development of a list of error codes documented by a coding manual, the verification of our manual and coding scheme by testing inter-coder reliability in a subset of the corpus (where we achieved a Kappa agreement score (Carletta, 1996) of a0 a1a3a2a5a4a7a6 )2, and the subsequent tagging of the entire corpus."
P02-1045	J96-2004	o	"The reliability of the annotations was checked using the kappa statistic (Carletta, 1996)."
P03-1008	J96-2004	o	"The annotation can be considered reliable (Krippendorff, 1980) with 95% agreement and a kappa (Carletta, 1996) of.88."
P03-1048	J96-2004	o	"Co-selection measures include precision and recall of co-selected sentences, relative utility (Radev et al. , 2000), and Kappa (Siegel and Castellan, 1988; Carletta, 1996)."
P03-1048	J96-2004	o	"3.1.2 Kappa Kappa (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) is an evaluation measure which is increasingly used in NLP annotation work (Krippendorff, 1980; Carletta, 1996)."
P04-1049	J96-2004	o	"Inter-annotator agreement was determined for six pairs of two annotators each, resulting in kappa values (Carletta (1996)) ranging from 0.62 to 0.82 for the whole database (Carlson et al."

P05-2014	J96-2004	o	"Labelling was carried out by three computational linguistics graduate students with 89% agreement resulting in a Kappa statistic of 0.87, which is a satisfactory indication that our corpus can be labelled with high reliability using our tag set (Carletta, 1996)."
P06-1050	J96-2004	o	"The kappa statistic (Krippendorff, 1980; Carletta, 1996) has become the de facto standard to assess inter-annotator agreement."

P09-1094	J96-2004	o	"Kappa is defined as K = P(A)P(E)1P(E) (Carletta, 1996), where P(A) is the proportion of times that the labels agree, and P(E) is the proportion of times that they may agree by chance."

find out the raterannotator agreement among ~ts lexicographers taggrog the word senses (Kllgamff, 1998c, Kllgarnff, 1998a, Kflgarrlff, 1998b) 2 A Case Study In this-paper, we examine the ~ssue of raterannotator agreement by comparing the agreement rate of human annotators on a large sense-tagged corpus of more than 30,000 instances of the most frequently occurring nouns and verbs of Enghsh This corpus is the intersection of the WORDNET Semcor corpus (Miller et al, 1993) and the DSO corpus (Ng and Lee, 1996, Ng, 1997), which has been independently tagged wlth the refined senses of WORDNET by two separate groups of human annotators The Semcor corpus us a subset of the Brown corpus tagged with ~VoRDNET senses, and consists of more than 670,000 words from 352 text files Sense taggmg was done on the content words (nouns, ~erbs, adjectives and adverbs) m this subset The DSO corpus consists of sentences drawn from the Brown corpus and the Wall Street Journal For each word w from a hst of 191 frequently occurring words of Enghsh (121 nouns and 70 verbs), sentences containing w (m singular or plural form, and m its various reflectional verb form) are selected and each word occurrence w ~s tagged w~th a sense from WoRDNET There ~s a total of about 192,800 sentences in the DSO corpus m which one word occurrence has been sense-tagged m each sentence The intersection of the Semcor corpus and the DSO corpus thus consists of Brown corpus sentences m which a word occurrence w is sense-tagged m each sentence, where w Is one of.the 191 frequently oc-,currmg English nouns or verbs Since this common pomon has been sense-tagged by two independent groups of human annotators, ~t serves as our data set for investigating inter-annotator agreement in this paper 3 Sentence Matching To determine the extent of inter-annotator agreement, the first step ~s to match each sentence m Semcor to its corresponding counterpart In the DSO corpus This step ~s comphcated by the following factors 1 Although the intersected portion of both corpora came from Brown corpus, they adopted different tokemzatmn convention, and segmentartan into sentences differed sometimes 2 The latest versmn of Semcor makes use of the senses from WORDNET 1 6, whereas the senses used m the DSO corpus were from WoRDNET 15 1 To match the sentences, we first converted the senses m the DSO corpus to those of WORDNET 1 6 We ignored all sentences m the DSO corpus m which a word is tagged with sense 0 or -1 (A word is tagged with sense 0 or -1 ff none of the given senses m WoRDNFT applies ) 4, sentence from Semcor is considered to match one from the DSO corpus ff both sentences are exactl) ldent~cal or ff the~ differ only m the pre~ence or absence of the characters "" (permd) or -' (hyphen) For each remaining Semcor sentence, taking into account word ordering, ff 75% or more of the words m the sentence match those in a DSO corpus sentence, then a potential match ~s recorded These i -kctua\[ly, the WORD~q'ET senses used m the DSO corpus were from a shght variant of the official WORDNE'I 1 5 release Th~s ssas brought to our attention after the pubhc release of the DSO corpus potential matches are then manually verffied to ensure that they are true matches and to ~eed out any false matches Using this method of matching, a total of 13,188 sentence-palrs contasnmg nouns and 17,127 sentence-pa~rs containing verbs are found to match from both corpora, ymldmg 30,315 sentences which form the intersected corpus used m our present study 4 The Kappa Statistic Suppose there are N sentences m our corpus where each sentence contains the word w Assume that w has M senses Let 4 be the number of sentences which are assigned identical sense b~ two human annotators Then a simple measure to quantify the agreement rate between two human annotators Is Pc, where Pc, = A/N The drawback of this simple measure is that it does not take into account chance agreement between two annotators The Kappa statistic a (Cohen, 1960) is a better measure of rater-annotator agreement which takes into account the effect of chance agreement It has been used recently w~thm computatmnal hngu~stlcs to measure raterannotator agreement (Bruce and Wmbe, 1998, Carletta, 1996, Veroms, 1998) Let Cj be the sum of the number of sentences which have been assigned sense 3 by annotator 1 and the number of sentences whmh have been assigned sense 3 by annotator 2 Then P~-P~ 1-P~ where M j=l and Pe measures the chance agreement between two annotators A Kappa ~alue of 0 indicates that the agreement is purely due to chance agreement, whereas a Kappa ~alue of 1 indicates perfect agreement A Kappa ~alue of 0 8 and above is considered as mdmatmg good agreement (Carletta, 1996) Table 1

the rater-annotator agreement on the intersected corpus is not high, we would like to find out how the agreement rate would be affected if different sense classes were in use In this section, we present a greedy search algorithm that can automatmalb derive coarser sense classes based on the sense tags assigned by two human annotators The resulting derived coarse sense classes achmve a higher agreement rate but we still maintain as many of the original sense classes as possible The algorithm is given m Figure 1 The algorithm operates on a set of sentences where each sentence contains an occurrence of the word w whmh has been sense-tagged by two human annotators At each Iteration of the algorithm, tt finds the pair of sense classes Ct and Cj such that merging these two sense classes results in the highest t~ value for the resulting merged group of sense classes It then proceeds to merge Cz and C~ Thin process Is repeated until the ~ value reaches a satisfactory value ~,~t,~, which we set as 0 8 Note that this algorithm is also applicable to deriving any coarser set of classes from a refined set for any NLP tasks in which prior human agreement rate may not be high enough Such NLP tasks could be discourse tagging, speech-act categorization, etc 6 Results For each word w from the list of 121 nouns and 70 verbs, ~e applied the greedy search algorithm to each set of sentences in the intersected corpus contaming w For a subset of 95 words (53 nouns and 42 verbs), the algorithm was able to derive a coarser set of 2 or more senses for each of these 95 words such that the resulting Kappa ~alue reaches 0 8 or higher For the other 96 words, m order for the Kappa value to reach 0 8 or higher, the algorithm collapses all senses of the ~ord to a single (trivial) class Table 2 and 3 summarizes the results for the set of 53 nouns and 42 ~erbs, respectively Table 2 md~cates that before the collapse of sense classes, these 53 nouns have an average of 7 6 senses per noun There is a total of 5,339 sentences in the intersected corpus containing these nouns, of which 3,387 sentences were assigned the same sense by the two groups of human annotators The average Kappa statistic (computed as a simple average of the Kappa statistic of ~he mdlwdual nouns) is 0 463 After the collapse of sense classes by the greedy search algorithm, the average number of senses per noun for these 53 nouns drops to 40 Howe~er, the number of sentences which have been asmgned the same coarse sense by the annotators increases to 5,033 That is, about 94 3% of the sentences have been assigned the same coarse sense, and that the average Kappa statistic has improved to 0 862, mgmfymg high rater-annotator agreement on the derived coarse senses Table3 gl~es the analogous figures for the 42 verbs, agmn mdmatmg that high agreement is achieved on the coarse sense classes den~ed for verbs 7 Discussion Our findings on rater-annotator agreement for word sense tagging indicate that for average language users, it is quite dl~cult to achieve high agreement when they are asked to assign refned sense tags (such as those found in WORDNET) given only the scanty definition entries m the WORDNET dlctionary and a few or no example sentences for the usage of each word sense Thin observation agrees wlth that obtmned m a recent study done by (Veroms, 1998), where the agreement on sense-tagging by naive users was also not hlgh Thus It appears that an average language user is able to process language wlthout needing to perform the task of dlsamblguatmg word sense to a very fine-grained resolutmn as formulated m a tradltlonal dmtlonary In contrast, expert lexicographers tagged the ~ ord sense in the sentences used m the SENSEVAL exerclse, where high rater-annotator agreement was reported There are also fuller dlctlonary entries m the HECTOR dlctlonary used and more e<amples showing the usage of each word sense m HECTOR These factors are likely to have contributed to the difference in rater-annotator agreement observed m the three studies conducted We also examined the coarse sense classes derived by the greedy search algorithm Vv'e found some interesting groupings of coarse senses for nouns which ~e hst in Table 4 From Table 4, it is apparent that the greedy search algorithm can derive interesting groupings of word senses that correspond to human mtmtwe judgment of sense graz}.ulanty It Is clear that some of the disagreement between the two groups of human annotators can be attributed solely to the overly refined senses of WoRDNET As an example, there is a total Ii loop: let Ct,, C M denote the current M sense classes ~* +--oo for all z,3 such that 1 <, < 3 < M let C\[,,C~w_ 1 denote the resulting M 1 sense classes by mergmg C,

found m closely related languages be given lesser (or greater) weight than those found m more distantly related languages 9 More generally, which languages should be considered for this exermse 9 All languages 9 Closely related languages9 Languages from different language famlhes '~ A mixture of the two 9 How many languages, and of which types, would be ""enough"" to provide adequate lnfotmanon tot this purpose~ There ts also the questmn ot the crlterm that would be used to estabhsh that a sense distinction is ""lexlcahzed cross-hngu~stmally"" How consistent must the d~stlnCtlOn be 9 Does it mean that two concepts are expressed by mutually non-lntetchangeable lexmal items in some slgmficant number ot other languages, or need tt only be the case that the option ot a different lexlcahzatlon exists m a certain percentage of cases 9 Another conslderatmn ts where the cross-hngual mformatlon to answer these questmns would come from Using bdmgual dictionaries would be extremely tedmus and error-prone, g~ven the substantial d~vergence among d~ctlonanes in terms of the kinds and degree of sense dlstmctmns they make Resmk and Yalowsky (1997) suggest EutoWordNet (Vossen, 1998) as a possible somce of mformatmn, but, given that EuroWordNet ts pttmatdy a lexmon and not a corpus, ~t is subject to many of the same objections as for bl-hngual dictionaries An alternative would be to gather the reformation from parallel, ahgned corpma Unlike bilingual and muttt-hngual dictionaries, translatmn eqmvalents xn parallel texts a~e determined by experienced translatols, who evaluate each instance ot a word's use m context rather than as a part of the meta-hngmst~c actlvlty of classifying senses for mclusmn in a dictionary However, at present very few parallel ahgned corpora exist The vast majority ot these are bl-texts, mvolwng only two languages, one of which is very often English Ideally, a serious 53 evaluation of Resnik and Yarowsky's proposal would include parallel texts m languages from several different language families, and, to maximally ensure that the word m question is used in the exact same sense across languages, ~t would be preferable that the same text were used over all languages in the study The only currently avadable parallel corpora for more than two languages are Olwell's Nmeteen Eighty-Four (Erjavec and Ide, 1998), Plato's Repubhc (Erjavec, et al, 1998), the MULTEXT Journal .o/ the Commt.~ston corpus (Ide and V6roms, 1994), and the Bible (Resnlk, et al, m press) It is likely that these corpora do not provide enough appropriate data to reliably determine sense distinctions Also, ~t Is not clear how the lexlcahzatlon of sense distractions across languages Is affected by genre, domain, style, etc Thls paper attempts to provide some prehmlnary answers to the questions outhned above, In order to eventually determine the degree to which the use of parallel data ts vmble to determine sense distinctions, and, ff so, the ways in which th~s reformation might be used Given the lack of lalge parallel texts across multiple languages, the study is necessarily hmlted, however, close exammanon of a small sample of parallel data can, as a first step, provide the basis and dlrectmn for more extensive studies 1 Methodology I have conducted a small study using parallel, aligned versmns ot George Orwell's Nineteen Etghtv-Fo,lr (Euavec and Ide, 1998)m five languages Enghsh, Slovene, Estonian, Romanlan, and Czech I The study therefole Involves languages from four language families The O~well parallel corpus also includes vers|ons o) Ntneteen-E~gho Four m Hungarian, Bulgarmn, Latwan, Llthuaman, Se~bmn, and Russmn (Germanic, Slavic, Fmno-Ugrec, and Romance), two languages from the same family (Czech and Slovene), as well as one non-Indo-European language (Estoman) Nmeteen Eighty-Four Is a text of about 100,000 words, translated directly from the original English m each of the other languages The parallel versions of the text are sentence-aligned to the English and tagged for part of speech Although Nineteen Eighty-Four is a work of fiction, Orwell's prose IS not highly stylized and, as such, it provides a reasonable sample ot modern, ordinary language that ~s not tied to a given topic or sub-domain (such as newspapers, technical reports, etc ) Furthermore, the translations of the text seem to be relatively faithful to the original for instance, over 95% ot the sentence alignments in the full pmallel corpus of seven languages are one-to-one (Prlest-Dorman, et al, 1997) Nine ambiguous English words were considered hard, head, country, hne, promise, shght, seize, scrap, float The first four were chosen because they have been used in other dlsamb~guatlon studies, the latter five were chosen from among the words used m the Senseval dlsamblguatlon exercise (Kllgamff and Palmer, forthcoming) In all cases, the study was necessarily hmlted to words that occurred frequently enough in the Orwell text to warrant consideration F~ve hundred forty-two sentences conta|nmg an occurrence or occurrences (Including morphological variants) of each of the nine words were extracted from the Enghsh text, together w~th the parallel sentences m which they occur m the texts ot the four comparison languages (Czech, Estonian, Romantan, Slovene) As Walks and Stevenson (1998) have pointed out, pa~t-of-speech tagging accomplishes a good portion of the work ot semantic dlsamb~guatmn, therefore occmrences of wolds that appemed in the data in more than 54 one part of speech were grouped separately 2 The Enghsh occurrences were then grouped usmg the sense distinctions m WordNet, (version 1 6) \[Miller et al, 1990, Fellbaum, 1998\]) The sense categonzatmn was performed by the author and two student assistants, results from the three were compared and a final, mutually agreeable set of sense assignments was estabhshed For each of the four comparison languages, the corpus of sense-grouped parallel sentences were sent to a llngmst and natl,ve speaker of the comparison language The hngmsts were asked to provide the lexlcal item m each parallel sentence that corresponds to the ambiguous Enghsh word If inflected, they were asked to provide both the inflected form and the root form In addttmn, the lmgmsts were asked to indicate the type of translatmn, according to the dtstmctmns given m Table 1 For over 85% of the Enghsh word occurrences (corresponding to types 1 and 2 m Table 1), a specific lexlcal item or items could be identified as the translation equivalent for the corresponding Enghsh word For comparison purposes, each translanon equivalent was represented by ~ts lemma (or the lemma of the toot form in the case of derivatives) and associated w~th the WordNet sense to which it corresponds In order to determine the degree to which the assigned sense dlstlncttons correspond to translation eqmvalents, a coherence index ( Cl) was computed that measures how often each pmr of senses is translated usmg the same word as well as the consistency with which a g~ven se,ls,z ~s translated with the same word ~ Note that the z The adJective and adverb senses of hard are consadeied together because the distinction is not consistent across the translations used m the study Note that the CI ~s similar to semanuc entropy (Melamed, 1997) However, Melamed computes CIs do not determine whether or not a sense dtstmctton can be lextcahzed in the target language, but only the degree to whmh they are lexicahzed differently m the translated text However, tt can be assumed that the CIs provide a measure of the tendency to lex~cahze different WordNet senses differently, which can m turn be seen as an mdtcatmn of the degree to which the distraction ts vahd For each ambiguous word, the CI Is computed for each pair of senses, as follows S<q t> Cl(sqS, ) = '=1 m rnrt where @ n ~s the number of comparison languages under consideration, nl~q and m,, are the nt~mber of occurrences olsense sqand sense s~ m the Enghsh corpus, respectively, including occurrences that have no idenufiable translation, s<~ ~>m ts the number of times that senses q and r are translated by the same lex~cal Item m language t, i e, x=y t ~tJan ~( q ), r~oan~( r ) The CI ts a value between 0 and 1, computed by examining clusters of occurrences translated by the same word In the othel languages If sense and sense ) are consistently translated w~th the same wo~d in each comparison language, then Cl(s, s~) = 1, if they are translated with a different word m every occurrence, Cl(s, ~) = 0 In general, the CI for pans of different senses provides an index of thmr relatedness, t e, the greater the value of Cl(s, sj), the more frequently occurrences of-sense t and sense j are translated with the same lextcal item When t = j, we entropy tOl wold types, lather than word senses 55 obtain a measure of the coherence of a ~lven sense Type Meaning 1 A slngle lexlcal Item is used to translate the En@izsh equivalent (possibly a 2 The English word is translated by a phrase of two or more words or a compound, meaning as the slngle English word 3 The En@izsh word is not

visualize the relationship between senses, a hierarchical clustering algorithm was applied to the CI data to generate trees reflecting sense proximity 4 Finally, in order to determine the degree to which the linguistic relaUon between languages may affect coherence, a correlation was run among CIs for all pairs of the four target languages Fol example, Table 2 gives the senses of hard and head

using a memc slmdar to the one used in this study, found that that non-Indo-European languages tended to lexlcallze English sense d~stmctlons more than Indo-European languages, especially at

(14) F,gure 3 Cluster tree and dmtance measures tot the tout senses ot head 58 Conclusion The small sample m this study suggests that cross-hngual lexlcahzat~on can be used to define and structure sense d~stmct~ons The cluster graphs above provide mformat~on about relations among WordNet senses that could be used, for example, to determine the granularity of sense differences, whtch m turn could be used in tasks such as machine translatton, mtormaUon retrieval, etc For example, it is hkely that as sense dtstmcttons become finer, the degree of error ~s less severe Resmk and Yarowsky (1997) suggest that confusing freer-grained sense dtstmctlons should be penahzed less severely than confusing grosser d~stmct~ons when evaluatmg the performance of sense dtsambtguatt0n systems The clusters also provide insight into the lexlcallzatlon of sense dtstmcttons related by various semantic relations (metonymy, meronymy, etc ) across languages, for instance, the ""part of the body"" and ""intellect"" senses of head are lex~cahzed with the same ~tem a s~gnlficant portion of the t~me across all languages, reformation that could be used m machine translatton In addtt~on, cluster data such as that presented here could be used m lexicography, to determine a mole detaded hierarchy of relations among senses in dtct~onary entries It is less clear how cross-hngual reformation can be used to determine sense d~st~nctlons independent of a pre-deflned set, such as the WordNet senses used here In an effort to explore how thts mlght be done, I have used the small sample from thts study to create word groupmgs from ""back translations"" (l e, additional translations m the original language ot the translations m the target language) and developed a metric that uses th~s mformatton to determine relatedness between occurrences, whtch ~s m turn used to cluster occurrences into sense groups I have also compared sets of back translations for words representing the various WordNet senses, which provtde word groups s~mdar to WordNet synsets Interestingly, there ts virtually no overlap between the WordNet synsets and word groups generated from back translations The results show, however, that sense dlstmctlons useful for natural language processing tasks such as machme translanon could potentsally be determined, ot at least influenced, by constdeHng this mformatton The automatically generated synsets themselves may also be useful m the same apphcatlons; where WordNet synsets (and ontologtes) have been used tn the past More work needs to be done on the topic of cross-hngual sense determination, utthzmg substantially larger parallel corpora that include a variety ot language types as well as texts fiom several genres This small study explores a possible

H05-1023	J97-3002	o	"In this respect, it resembles bilingual bracketing (Wu, 1997), but our model has more lexical items in the blocks with many-to-many word alignment freedom in both inner and outer parts."
H05-1036	J97-3002	o	"These techniques included unweighted FS morphology, conditional random fields (Lafferty et al. , 2001), synchronous parsers (Wu, 1997; Melamed, 2003), lexicalized parsers (Eisner and Satta, 1999),22 partially supervised training `a la (Pereira and Schabes, 1992),23 and grammar induction (Klein and Manning, 2002)."
H05-1098	J97-3002	o	"Since one of these filters restricts the number of nonterminal symbols to two, our extracted grammar is equivalent to an inversion transduction grammar (Wu, 1997)."

J07-2003	J97-3002	o	"This also makes our grammar weakly equivalent to an inversion transduction grammar (Wu 1997), although the conversion would create a very large number of new nonterminal symbols."
J07-2003	J97-3002	o	"Because our system uses a synchronous CFG, it could be thought of as an example of syntax-based statistical machine translation (MT), joining a line of research (Wu 1997; Alshawi, Bangalore, and Douglas 2000; Yamada and Knight 2001) that has been fruitful but has not previously produced systems that can compete with phrase-based systems in large-scale translation tasks such as the evaluations held by NIST."
J07-2003	J97-3002	o	"At one extreme are those, exemplified by that of Wu (1997), that have no dependence on syntactic theory beyond the idea that natural language is hierarchical."
N03-1017	J97-3002	o	"Another motivation to evaluate the performance of a phrase translation model that contains only syntactic phrases comes from recent efforts to built syntactic translation models [Yamada and Knight, 2001; Wu, 1997]."

N07-1052	J97-3002	o	"We can, however, produce a useful surrogate: a pair of monolingual WCFGs with structures projected by G and weights that, when combined, underestimate the costs of G. Parsing optimally relative to a synchronous grammar using a dynamic program requires time O(n6) in the length of the sentence (Wu, 1997)."

N09-1026	J97-3002	o	"Meanwhile, translation grammars have grown in complexity from simple inversion transduction grammars (Wu, 1997) to general tree-to-string transducers (Galley et al., 2004) and have increased in size by including more synchronous tree fragments (Galley et al., 2006; Marcuetal.,2006; DeNeefeetal.,2007)."

Their models are based on mechanisms that generate two languages at the same time, so an English tree a15 is obtained as a subproduct of parsing a16 . However, their use of the LM is not mathematically motivated, since their models do not decompose into Pa4a5a2a9a8a3a10a6 and a12a14a4a5a3a7a6 unlike the noisy channel model."
P03-1011	J97-3002	p	Wu (1997) showed that restricting word-level alignments between sentence pairs to observe syntactic bracketing constraints significantly reduces the complexity of the alignment problem and allows a polynomial-time solution.

P06-1098	J97-3002	p	"In the hierarchical phrase-based model (Chiang, 2005), and an inversion transduction grammar (ITG) (Wu, 1997), the problem is resolved by restricting to a binarized form where at most two non-terminals are allowed in the righthand side."
P06-1121	J97-3002	o	"7 Related work Similarly to (Poutsma, 2000; Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Chiang, 2005), the rules discussed in this paper are equivalent to productions of synchronous tree substitution grammars."
P06-1123	J97-3002	p	"Wu (1997) has been unable to find real examples of cases where hierarchical alignment would fail under these conditions, at least in fixed-word-order languages that are lightly inflected, such as English and Chinese. (p. 385)."
P06-1123	J97-3002	o	"Following Wu (1997), the prevailing opinion in the research community has been that more complex patterns of word alignment in real bitexts are mostly attributable to alignment errors."
P06-1123	J97-3002	o	"A hierarchical alignment algorithm is a type of synchronous parser where, instead of constraining inferences by the production rules of a grammar, the constraints come from word alignments and possibly other sources (Wu, 1997; Melamed and Wang, 2005)."

P06-2122	J97-3002	n	"Synchronous grammar formalisms that are capable of modeling such complex relationships while maintaining the context-free property in each language have been proposed for many years, (Aho and Ullman, 1972; Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Melamed, 2003; Chiang, 2005), but have not been scaled to large corpora and long sentences until recently."

P08-2038	J97-3002	p	"1 Introduction In recent years, Bracketing Transduction Grammar (BTG) proposed by (Wu, 1997) has been widely used in statistical machine translation (SMT)."
P09-1009	J97-3002	p	"Research in this direction was pioneered by (Wu, 1997), who developed Inversion Transduction Grammars to capture crosslingual grammar variations such as phrase reorderings."
P09-1036	J97-3002	o	"In this paper, we implement the SDB model in a state-of-the-art phrase-based system which adapts a binary bracketing transduction grammar (BTG) (Wu, 1997) to phrase translation and reordering, described in (Xiong et al., 2006)."
P09-1053	J97-3002	o	"Most related to our approach, Wu (2005) used inversion transduction grammarsa synchronous context-free formalism (Wu, 1997)for this task."
P09-1065	J97-3002	o	"(2006) develop a bottom-up decoder for BTG (Wu, 1997) that uses only phrase pairs."
P09-1088	J97-3002	o	"Moreover, the inference procedure for each sentence pair is non-trivial, proving NP-complete for learning phrase based models (DeNero and Klein, 2008) or a high order polynomial (O(|f|3|e|3))1 for a sub-class of weighted synchronous context free grammars (Wu, 1997)."
P09-1088	J97-3002	o	"Following the broad shift in the field from finite state transducers to grammar transducers (Chiang, 2007), recent approaches to phrase-based alignment have used synchronous grammar formalisms permitting polynomial time inference (Wu, 1997; 783 Cherry and Lin, 2007; Zhang et al., 2008b; Blunsom et al., 2008)."

P09-2036	J97-3002	o	"There are rules, though rare, that cannot be binarized synchronously at all (Wu, 1997), but can be incorporated in two-stage decoding with asynchronous binarization."
P98-1006	J97-3002	n	"The work reported in Wu (1997), which uses an inside-outside type of training algorithm to learn statistical contextfree transduction, has a similar motivation to the current work, but the models we describe here, being fully lexical, are more suitable for direct statistical modelling."
P98-1074	J97-3002	o	"Unfortunately, this is not always the case, and the above methodology suffers from the weaknesses pointed out by (Wu, 1997) concerning parse-parse-match procedures."
P98-1076	J97-3002	o	"Consequently, the mainstream research in the literature has been focused on the modeling and utilization of local and sentential contexts, either linguistically in a rule-based framework or statistically in a searching and optimization set-up (Gan, Palmer and Lua 1996; Sproat, Shih, Gale and Chang 1996; Wu 1997; Gut 1997)."
P98-2230	J97-3002	o	"The model employs a stochastic version of an inversion transduction grammar or ITG (Wu, 1995c; Wu, 1995d; Wu, 1997)."

P98-2230	J97-3002	o	"If the target CFG is purely binary branching, then the previous theoretical and linguistic analyses (Wu, 1997) suggest that much of the requisite constituent and word order transposition may be accommodated without change to the mirrored ITG."
W00-0508	J97-3002	o	"There are other approaches to statistical machine translation where translation is achieved through transduction of source language structure to target language structure (Alshawi et al. , 1998b; Wu, 1997)."
W02-1039	J97-3002	p	"Several studies have reported alignment or translation performance for syntactically augmented translation models (Wu, 1997; Wang, 1998; Alshawi et al. , 2000; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Jones and Havrilla, 1998) and these results have been promising."
W03-0303	J97-3002	o	"2 Bilingual Bracketing In [Wu 1997], the Bilingual Bracketing PCFG was introduced, which can be simplified as the following production rules: A ! [AA] (1) A ! < AA > (2) A ! f=e (3) A ! f=null (4) A ! null=e (5) Where f and e are words in the target vocabulary Vf and source vocabulary Ve respectively."
W03-0303	J97-3002	o	"However, instead of estimating the probabilities for the production rules via EM as described in [Wu 1997], we assign the probabilities to the rules using the Model-1 statistical translation lexicon [Brown et al. 1993]."
W03-0303	J97-3002	o	Bilingual Bracketing [Wu 1997] is one of the bilingual shallow parsing approaches studied for Chinese-English word alignment.
W03-0303	J97-3002	p	"More suitable ways could be bilingual chunk parsing, and refining the bracketing grammar as described in [Wu 1997]."

W03-1807	J97-3002	o	"Related Works Generally speaking, approaches to MWE extraction proposed so far can be divided into three categories: a) statistical approaches based on frequency and co-occurrence affinity, b) knowledgebased or symbolic approaches using parsers, lexicons and language filters, and c) hybrid approaches combining different methods (Smadja 1993; Dagan and Church 1994; Daille 1995; McEnery et al. 1997; Wu 1997; Wermter et al. 1997; Michiels and Dufour 1998; Merkel and Andersson 2000; Piao and McEnery 2001; Sag et al. 2001a, 2001b; Biber et al. 2003)."

W05-0803	J97-3002	o	"The only requirement will be that a parallel corpus exist for the language under consideration and one or more other languages.2 Induction of grammars from parallel corpora is rarely viewed as a promising task in its own right; in work that has addressed the issue directly (Wu, 1997; Melamed, 2003; Melamed, 2004), the synchronous grammar is mainly viewed as instrumental in the process of improving the translation model in a noisy channel approach to statistical MT.3 In the present paper, we provide an important prerequisite for parallel corpus-based grammar induction work: an efficient algorithm for synchronous parsing of sentence pairs, given a word alignment."
W05-0803	J97-3002	o	"Graphically speaking, parsing amounts to identifying rectangular crosslinguistic constituents  by assembling smaller rectangles that will together cover the full string spans in both dimensions (compare (Wu, 1997; Melamed, 2003))."

D09-1023	N03-1017	o	"2.4 Reordering Reordering features take many forms in MT. In phrase-based systems, reordering is accomplished both within phrase pairs (local reordering) as well as through distance-based distortion models (Koehn et al., 2003) and lexicalized reordering models (Koehn et al., 2007)."
D09-1023	N03-1017	p	"1 Introduction We have seen rapid recent progress in machine translation through the use of rich features and the development of improved decoding algorithms, often based on grammatical formalisms.1 If we view MT as a machine learning problem, features and formalisms imply structural independence assumptions, which are in turn exploited by efficient inference algorithms, including decoders (Koehn et al., 2003; Yamada and Knight, 2001)."
D09-1037	N03-1017	o	"These heuristics are extensions of those developed for phrase-based models (Koehn et al., 2003), and involve symmetrising two directional word alignments followed by a projection step which uses the alignments to find a mapping between source words and nodes in the target parse trees (Galley et al., 2004)."
D09-1037	N03-1017	o	"The rules are then treated as events in a relative frequency estimate.4 We used Giza++ Model 4 to obtain word alignments (Och and Ney, 2003), using the grow-diag-final-and heuristic to symmetrise the two directional predictions (Koehn et al., 2003)."

D09-1106	N03-1017	p	"Besides relative frequencies, lexical weights (Koehn et al., 2003) are widely used to estimate how well the words in f translate the words in e. To do this, one needs first to estimate a lexical translation probability distribution w(e|f) by relative frequency from the same word alignments in the training corpus: w(e|f) = count(f,e)summationtext e count(f,e) (3) Note that a special source NULL token is added to each source sentence and aligned to each unaligned target word."

P08-1009	N03-1017	p	"Phrase-based decoding (Koehn et al., 2003) is a dominant formalism in statistical machine translation."
P08-1009	N03-1017	o	"Early experiments with syntactically-informed phrases (Koehn et al., 2003), and syntactic reranking of K-best lists (Och et al., 2004) produced mostly negative results."
P08-1009	N03-1017	o	"Restricting phrases to syntactic constituents has been shown to harm performance (Koehn et al., 2003), so we tighten our definition of a violation to disregard cases where the only point of overlap is obscured by our phrasal resolution."

P08-1010	N03-1017	o	"Since most phrases appear only a few times in training data, a phrase pair translation is also evaluated by lexical weights (Koehn et al., 2003) or term weighting (Zhao et al., 2004) as additional features to avoid overestimation."
P08-1010	N03-1017	o	"The commonly used phrase extraction approach based on word alignment heuristics (referred as ViterbiExtract algorithm for comparison in this paper) as described in (Och, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003) is a special case of the algorithm, where candidate phrase pairs are restricted to those that respect word alignment boundaries."
P08-1011	N03-1017	o	"In most statistical machine translation (SMT) models (Och et al., 2004; Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang, 2005), some of measure words can be generated without modification or additional processing."

P08-1114	N03-1017	o	"In addition to this phrase translation probability feature, Hieros feature set includes the inverse phrase translation probability log p( f|e), lexical weights lexwt( f|e) and lexwt(e| f), which are estimates of translation quality based on word-level correspondences (Koehn et al., 2003), and a rule penalty allowing the model to learn a preference for longer or shorter derivations; see (Chiang, 2007) for details."
P08-1115	N03-1017	o	"Models that support non-monotonic decoding generally include a distortion cost, such as|aibi11|where ai is the starting position of the foreign phrasefi andbi1 is the ending position of phrase fi1 (Koehn et al., 2003)."

P08-2041	N03-1017	n	"1 Introduction Currently, most of the phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT) models (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003) adopt full matching strategy for phrase translation, which means that a phrase pair (tildewidef,tildewidee) can be used for translating a source phrase f, only if tildewidef = f. Due to lack of generalization ability, the full matching strategy has some limitations."
P09-1036	N03-1017	n	"In such a process, original phrase-based decoding (Koehn et al., 2003) does not take advantage of any linguistic analysis, which, however, is broadly used in rule-based approaches."
P09-1036	N03-1017	o	"This, unfortunately, significantly jeopardizes performance (Koehn et al., 2003; Xiong et al., 2008) because by integrating syntactic constraint into decoding as a hard constraint, it simply prohibits any other useful non-syntactic translations which violate constituent boundaries."

Phrase-based models (Koehn et al. , 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) are good at learning local translations that are pairs of (consecutive) sub-strings, but often insufficient in modeling the reorderings of phrases themselves, especially between language pairs with very different word-order."

W07-0721	N03-1017	o	"1 Introduction Nowadays, statistical machine translation is mainly based on phrases (Koehn et al. , 2003)."

W07-0725	N03-1017	o	"2 Architecture of the system The goal of statistical machine translation (SMT) is to produce a target sentence e from a source sentence f. It is today common practice to use phrases as translation units (Koehn et al. , 2003; Och and Ney, 2003) and a log linear framework in order to introduce several models explaining the translation process: e??= argmaxp(e|f) = argmaxe {exp(summationdisplay i ihi(e,f))} (1) The feature functions hi are the system models and the i weights are typically optimized to maximize a scoring function on a development set (Och and Ney, 2002)."

W07-1512	N03-1017	o	"However, many of these models are not applicable to parallel treebanks because they assume translation units where either the source text, the target text or both are represented as word sequences without any syntactic structure (Galley et al. , 2004; Marcu et al. , 2006; Koehn et al. , 2003)."

D09-1161	N06-1020	o	"The other is the self-training (McClosky et al. 2006) which first parses and reranks the NANC corpus, and then use them as additional training data to retrain the model."
E09-1033	N06-1020	o	"Third, we hope that the improved parses of bitext will serve as higher quality training data for improving monolingual parsing using a process similar to self-training (McClosky et al., 2006)."
E09-1090	N06-1020	o	"A totally different approach to improving the accuracy of our parser is to use the idea of selftraining described in (McClosky et al., 2006)."
E09-3005	N06-1020	o	"The problem itself has started to get attention only recently (Roark and Bacchiani, 2003; Hara et al., 2005; Daume III and Marcu, 2006; Daume III, 2007; Blitzer et al., 2006; McClosky et al., 2006; Dredze et al., 2007)."
E09-3005	N06-1020	o	"In contrast, semi-supervised domain adaptation (Blitzer et al., 2006; McClosky et al., 2006; Dredze et al., 2007) is the scenario in which, in addition to the labeled source data, we only have unlabeled and no labeled target domain data."
E09-3005	N06-1020	p	"2 Motivation and Prior Work While several authors have looked at the supervised adaptation case, there are less (and especially less successful) studies on semi-supervised domain adaptation (McClosky et al., 2006; Blitzer et al., 2006; Dredze et al., 2007)."
E09-3005	N06-1020	o	"So far, most previous work on domain adaptation for parsing has focused on data-driven systems (Gildea, 2001; Roark and Bacchiani, 2003; McClosky et al., 2006; Shimizu and Nakagawa, 2007), i.e. systems employing (constituent or dependency based) treebank grammars (Charniak, 1996)."
E09-3005	N06-1020	o	"Parse selection constitutes an important part of many parsing systems (Johnson et al., 1999; Hara et al., 2005; van Noord and Malouf, 2005; McClosky et al., 2006)."
I08-2097	N06-1020	p	"There are only a few successful studies, such as (Ando and Zhang, 2005) for chunking and (McClosky et al., 2006a; McClosky et al., 2006b) on constituency parsing."

N07-1070	N06-1020	o	"Recently there have been some improvements to the Charniak parser, use n-best re-ranking as reported in (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) and selftraining and re-ranking using data from the North American News corpus (NANC) and adapts much better to the Brown corpus (McClosky et al. , 2006a; McClosky et al. , 2006b)."
N07-1070	N06-1020	o	"The syntactic parser is the version that is selftrained using 2,500,000 sentences from NANC, and where the starting version is trained only on WSJ data (McClosky et al. , 2006b)."
N07-2045	N06-1020	o	"As far as we know, language modeling always improves with additional training data, so we add data from the North American News Text Corpus (NANC) (Graff, 1995) automatically parsed with the Charniak parser (McClosky et al. , 2006) to train our language model on up to 20 million additional words."
P06-1043	N06-1020	o	"While (McClosky et al. , 2006) showed that this technique was effective when testing on WSJ, the true distribution was closer to WSJ so it made sense to emphasize it."
P06-1043	N06-1020	o	"Thus, the WSJ+NANC model has better oracle rates than the WSJ model (McClosky et al. , 2006) for both the WSJ and BROWN domains."
P06-1043	N06-1020	p	"Recent work, (McClosky et al. , 2006), has shown that adding many millions of words of machine parsed and reranked LA Times articles does, in fact, improve performance of the parser on the closely related WSJ data."
P06-1043	N06-1020	o	"To use the data from NANC, we use self-training (McClosky et al. , 2006)."
P06-1043	N06-1020	p	"Furthermore, use of the self-training techniques described in (McClosky et al. , 2006) raise this to 87.8% (an error reduction of 28%) again without any use of labeled Brown data."
P06-1043	N06-1020	o	"The trends are the same as in (McClosky et al. , 2006): Adding NANC data improves parsing performance on BROWN development considerably, improving the f-score from 83.9% to 86.4%."

P07-1036	N06-1020	o	"Another way to look the algorithm is from the self-training perspective (McClosky et al. , 2006)."
P07-1049	N06-1020	o	"This can either be semi-supervised parsing, using both annotated and unannotated data (McClosky et al. , 2006) or unsupervised parsing, training entirely on unannotated text."
P07-1051	N06-1020	n	"While most parsing methods are currently supervised or semi-supervised (McClosky et al. 2006; Henderson 2004; Steedman et al. 2003), they depend on hand-annotated data which are difficult to come by and which exist only for a few languages."
P07-1078	N06-1020	o	"Unknown words were not identified in (McClosky et al. , 2006a) as a useful predictor for the benefit of self-training."
P07-1078	N06-1020	o	"622 We also identified a length effect similar to that studied by (McClosky et al. , 2006a) for self-training (using a reranker and large seed, as detailed in Section 2)."
P07-1078	N06-1020	o	"Indeed, in the II scenario, (Steedman et al. , 2003a; McClosky et al. , 2006a; Charniak, 1997) reported no improvement of the base parser for small (500 sentences, in the first paper) and large (40K sentences, in the last two papers) seed datasets respectively."
P07-1078	N06-1020	p	"In the II, OO, and OI scenarios, (McClosky et al, 2006a; 2006b) succeeded in improving the parser performance only when a reranker was used to reorder the 50-best list of the generative parser, with a seed size of 40K sentences."
P07-1078	N06-1020	p	"Recently, (McClosky et al. , 2006a; McClosky et al. , 2006b) have successfully applied self-training to various parser adaptation scenarios using the reranking parser of (Charniak and Johnson, 2005)."
P07-1078	N06-1020	o	"McClosky et al (2006a) use sections 2-21 of the WSJ PennTreebank as seed data and between 50K to 2,500K unlabeled NANC corpus sentences as self-training data."
P07-1078	N06-1020	p	"As a result, the good results of (McClosky et al, 2006a; 2006b) with large seed sets do not immediately imply success with small seed sets."

N07-3003	N06-1025	p	The novel idea presented in Strube & Ponzetto (2006) was to induce a semantic network from the Wikipedia categorization graph to compute measures of semantic relatedness.
N07-3003	N06-1025	o	"Accordingly, in Ponzetto & Strube (2006) we used a machine learning based coreference resolution system to provide an extrinsic evaluation of the utility of WordNet and Wikipedia relatedness measures for NLP applications."

W07-0405	N06-1033	p	"Synchronous binarization (Zhang et al. , 2006) solves this problem by simultaneously binarizing both source and target-sides of a synchronous rule, making sure of contiguous spans on both sides whenever possible."
W07-0405	N06-1033	o	"Decoding with an SCFG (e.g. , translating from Chinese to English using the above grammar) can be cast as a parsing problem (see Section 3 for details), in which case we need to binarize a synchronous rule with more than two nonterminals to achieve polynomial time algorithms (Zhang et al. , 2006)."
W07-0405	N06-1033	o	"Intuitively speaking, the gaps on the target-side will lead to exponential complexity in decoding with integrated language models (see Section 3), as well as synchronous parsing (Zhang et al. , 2006)."
W07-0405	N06-1033	o	"This representation, being contiguous on both sides, successfully reduces the decoding complexity to a low polynomial and significantly improved the search quality (Zhang et al. , 2006)."
W07-0412	N06-1033	o	"On the positive side, recent work exploring the automaticbinarizationofsynchronousgrammars(Zhang et al. , 2006) has indicated that non-binarizable constructions seem to be relatively rare in practice."

C08-1008	N06-1041	o	This is the scenario considered by Haghighi and Klein (2006) for POS tagging: how to construct an accurate tagger given a set of tags and a few example words for each of those tags.
C08-1042	N06-1041	o	"The mapping typically is made to try to give the most favorable mapping in terms of accuracy, typically using a greedy assignment (Haghighi and Klein, 2006)."
D07-1023	N06-1041	o	"Haghighi and Klein s (2006) prototype-driven approach requires just a few prototype examples for each POS tag, exploiting these labeled words to constrain the labels of their distributionally similar words when training a generative log-linear model for POS tagging."
D07-1031	N06-1041	o	"In fact, we found that it doesnt do so badly at all: the bitag HMM estimated by EM achieves a mean 1-to1 tagging accuracy of 40%, which is approximately the same as the 41.3% reported by (Haghighi and Klein, 2006) for their sophisticated MRF model."
D07-1031	N06-1041	o	"Most previous work exploiting unsupervised training data for inferring POS tagging models has focused on semi-supervised methods in the in which the learner is provided with a lexicon specifying the possible tags for each word (Merialdo, 1994; Smith and Eisner, 2005; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007) or a small number of prototypes for each POS (Haghighi and Klein, 2006)."
D07-1031	N06-1041	o	Haghighi and Klein (2006) propose constraining the mapping from hidden states to POS tags so that at most one hidden state maps to any POS tag.
D07-1031	N06-1041	o	"It is difficult to compare these with previous work, but Haghighi and Klein (2006) report that in a completely unsupervised setting, their MRF model, which uses a large set of additional features and a more complex estimation procedure, achieves an average 1-to-1 accuracy of 41.3%."
D08-1004	N06-1041	o	"Haghighi and Klein (2006) do the reverse: for each class label y, they ask the annotators to propose a few prototypical featuresf such thatp(y|f) is as high as possible."
D08-1036	N06-1041	o	"Finally, following Haghighi and Klein (2006) and Johnson (2007) we can instead insist that at most one HMM state can be mapped to any part-of-speech tag."
D08-1109	N06-1041	o	"In addition, a number of approaches have focused on developing discriminative approaches for unsupervised and semi-supervised tagging (Smith and Eisner, 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2006)."
D09-1009	N06-1041	o	"We use the same feature processing as Haghighi and Klein (2006), with the addition of context features in a window of3."
D09-1009	N06-1041	n	"The 74.6% final accuracy on apartments is higher than any result obtained by Haghighi and Klein (2006) (the highest is 74.1%), higher than the supervised HMM results reported by Grenager et al."
D09-1009	N06-1041	o	"For example, both Haghighi and Klein (2006) and Mann and McCallum (2008) have demonstrated results better than 66.1% on the apartments task described above using only a list of 33 highly discriminative features and the labels they indicate."
D09-1009	N06-1041	o	"Consequently, we abstract away from specifying a distribution by allowing the user to assign labels to features (c.f. Haghighi and Klein (2006) , Druck et al."
D09-1009	N06-1041	o	"Similarly, prototype-driven learning (PDL) (Haghighi and Klein, 2006) optimizes the joint marginal likelihood of data labeled with prototype input features for each label."
D09-1072	N06-1041	o	"One other work that investigates the use of a limited lexicon is (Haghighi&Klein, 2006), which develops a prototype-drive approach to propagate the categorical property using distributional similarity features; using only three exemplars of each tag, they achieve a tagging accuracy of 80.5% using a somewhat larger dataset but also the full Penn tagset, which is much larger."
D09-1134	N06-1041	o	"This sparse information, however, can be propagated across all data based on distributional similarity (Haghighi and Klein, 2006)."
D09-1134	N06-1041	o	"Prototype-drive learning (Haghighi and Klein, 2006) specifies prior knowledge by providing a few prototypes (i.e., canonical example words) for each label."
D09-1134	N06-1041	o	"In this work, we use the prototype lists originally defined by Haghighi and Klein (2006) (HK06) and subsequently used by Chang et al."

E09-1042	N06-1041	o	"Haghighi and Klein (2006) develop a prototype-driven approach, which requires just a few prototype examples for each POS tag and exploits these labeled words to constrain the labels of their distributionally similar words."
I08-1069	N06-1041	o	"Still, however, such techniques often require seeds, or prototypes (c.f., (Haghighi and Klein, 2006)) which are used to prune search spaces or direct learners."
I08-1069	N06-1041	p	Haghighi and Klein (2006) showed that adding a small set of prototypes to the unlabeled data can improve tagging accuracy significantly.
I08-1069	N06-1041	o	"For instance, the frequency collected from the data can be used to bias initial transition and emission probabilities in an HMM model; the tagged words in IGT can be used to label the resulting clusters produced by the word clustering approach; the frequent and unambiguous words in the target lines can serve as prototype examples in the prototype-driven approach (Haghighi and Klein, 2006)."
I08-2093	N06-1041	o	"The recent work of (Haghighi and Klein, 2006) and (Quirk et al., 2005) were also sources of inspiration."
I08-2093	N06-1041	o	"In some recent grammar induction and MT work (Haghighi and Klein, 2006; Quirk et al., 2005) it has been shown that even a small amount of knowledge about a language, in the form of grammar fragments, treelets or prototypes, can go a long way in helping with the induction of a grammar from raw text or with alignment of parallel corpora."
N07-1057	N06-1041	o	"The order of constituents, for instance, can be used to inform prototype-driven learning strategies (Haghighi and Klein, 2006), which can then be applied to raw corpora."
N07-1057	N06-1041	o	"In particular, knowing a little about the structure of a language can help in developing annotated corpora and tools, since a little knowledge can go a long way in inducing accurate structure and annotations (Haghighi and Klein, 2006)."
N09-1034	N06-1041	o	"This has been shown both in supervised settings (Roth and Yih, 2004; Riedel and Clarke, 2006) and unsupervised settings (Haghighi and Klein, 2006; Chang et al., 2007) in which constraints are used to bootstrap the model."
N09-3010	N06-1041	o	Haghighi and Klein (2006) ask the user to suggest a few prototypes (examples) for each class and use those as features.
N09-3010	N06-1041	o	"Supervision for simple features has been explored in the literature (Raghavan et al., 2006; Druck et al., 2008; Haghighi and Klein, 2006)."
P07-1035	N06-1041	o	"First, we use the standard approach of greedily assigning each of the learned classes to the POS tag with which it has the greatest overlap, and then computing tagging accuracy (Smith and Eisner, 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2006).8 Additionally, we compute the mutual information of the learned clusters with the gold tags, and we compute the cluster F-score (Ghosh, 2003)."
P07-1035	N06-1041	o	"For comparison, Haghighi and Klein (2006) report an unsupervised baseline of 41.3%, and a best result of 80.5% from using hand-labeled prototypes and distributional similarity."
P07-1036	N06-1041	o	"In many cases, improving semi-supervised models was done by seeding these models with domain information taken from dictionaries or ontology (Cohen and Sarawagi, 2004; Collins and Singer, 1999; Haghighi and Klein, 2006; Thelen and Riloff, 2002)."

H05-2007	P02-1040	o	"1 Introduction Over the last few years, several automatic metrics for machine translation (MT) evaluation have been introduced, largely to reduce the human cost of iterative system evaluation during the development cycle (Papineni et al. , 2002; Melamed et al. , 2003)."
I05-2021	P02-1040	o	"However, recent progress in machine translation and the continuous improvement on evaluation metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al. , 2002) suggest that SMT systems are already very good at choosing correct word translations."
I05-2039	P02-1040	o	"Because it is not feasible here to have humans judge the quality of many sets of translated data, we rely on an array of well known automatic evaluation measures to estimate translation quality :  BLEU (Papineni et al. 2002) is the geometric mean of the n-gram precisions in the output with respect to a set of reference translations."
I05-2042	P02-1040	n	"Although, there are various manual/automatic evaluation methods for these systems, e.g., BLEU (Papineni et al. 2002), these methods are basically incapable of dealing with an MTsystem and a w/p-MT-system at the same time, as they have different output forms."

P07-1044	P02-1040	o	"BLEU (Papineni et al. , 2002) is a canonical example: in matching n-grams in a candidate translation text with those in a reference text, the metric measures faithfulness by counting the matches, and fluency by implicitly using the reference n-grams as a language model."
P07-1066	P02-1040	o	"During evaluation two performance metrics, BLEU (Papineni et al. , 2002) and NIST, were computed."

P07-1108	P02-1040	p	"The translation quality was evaluated using a well-established automatic measure: BLEU score (Papineni et al. , 2002)."
P07-1111	P02-1040	o	"Since the introduction of BLEU (Papineni et al. , 2002) the basic n-gram precision idea has been augmented in a number of ways."
P07-2026	P02-1040	o	"3.3 BLEU Score The BLEU score (Papineni et al. , 2002) measures the agreement between a hypothesiseI1 generated by the MT system and a reference translation eI1."
P07-2045	P02-1040	o	It also contains tools for tuning these models using minimum error rate training (Och 2003) and evaluating the resulting translations using the BLEU score (Papineni et al. 2002).

P08-1010	P02-1040	o	"Other possibilities for the weighting include assigning constant one or the exponential of the final score etc. One of the advantages of the proposed phrase training algorithm is that it is a parameterized procedure that can be optimized jointly with the trans82 lation engine to minimize the final translation errors measured by automatic metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002)."
P08-1011	P02-1040	o	"In addition to precision and recall, we also evaluate the Bleu score (Papineni et al., 2002) changes before and after applying our measure word generation method to the SMT output."

P08-1112	P02-1040	o	"Unfortunately, as was shown by Fraser and Marcu (2007) AER can have weak correlation with translation performance as measured by BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002), when the alignments are used to train a phrase-based translation system."
P08-2015	P02-1040	o	"We use the standard NIST MTEval data sets for the years 2003, 2004 and 2005 (henceforth MT03, MT04 and MT05, respectively).6 We report results in terms of case-insensitive 4gram BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) scores."

P09-1034	P02-1040	p	"Since human evaluation is costly and difficult to do reliably, a major focus of research has been on automatic measures of MT quality, pioneered by BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and NIST (Doddington, 2002)."

D09-1036	P02-1047	o	2 Related Work One of the first works that use statistical methods to detect implicit discourse relations is that of Marcu and Echihabi (2002).
I05-6007	P02-1047	o	"Syntactic criteria are relevant, but clearly not decisive, as can be observed in (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002)."

N04-1020	P02-1047	o	A similar approach has been advocated for the interpretation of discourse relations by Marcu and Echihabi (2002).
N04-1020	P02-1047	o	"Apart from the fact that we present an alternative model, our work differs from Marcu and Echihabi (2002) in two important ways."
N06-2034	P02-1047	o	(Marcu and Echihabi 2002) proposed a method to identify discourse relations between text segments using Nave Bayes classifiers trained on a huge corpus.
N06-2034	P02-1047	o	"When we consider the frequency of discourse relations, i.e. 43% for ELABORATION, 32% for CONTRAST etc. , the weighted accuracy was 53% using only lexical information, which is comparable to the similar experiment by (Marcu and Echihabi 2002) of 49.7%."
N07-1038	P02-1047	o	The effectiveness of these features for recognition of discourse relations has been previously shown by Marcu and Echihabi (2002).
N07-1038	P02-1047	o	"Since this relation can often be determined automatically for a given text (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002), we can readily use it to improve rank prediction."
N07-1054	P02-1047	o	We draw on and extend the work of Marcu and Echihabi (2002).
N07-1054	P02-1047	o	"Marcu and Echihabi (2002) use a pattern-based approach in mining instances of RSRs such as Contrast and Elaboration from large, unannotated corpora."

P04-1087	P02-1047	o	"As such, discourse markers play an important role in the parsing of natural language discourse (Forbes et al. , 2001; Marcu, 2000), and their correspondence with discourse relations can be exploited for the unsupervised learning of discourse relations (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002)."
P05-1019	P02-1047	o	"For such cases, unsupervised approaches have been developed for predicting relations, by using sentences containing discourse connectives as training data (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002; Lapata and Lascarides, 2004)."

P08-1034	P02-1053	o	"For example, it has been observed that texts often contain multiple opinions on different topics (Turney, 2002; Wiebe et al., 2001), which makes assignment of the overall sentiment to the whole document problematic."

W05-0408	P02-1053	o	"We can then use this newly identified set to: (1) use Turneys method to find the orientation for the terms and employ the terms and their scores in a classifier, and (2) use Turneys method to find the orientation for the terms and add the new terms as additional seed terms for a second iteration As opposed to Turney (2002), we do not use the web as a resource to find associations, rather we apply the method directly to in-domain data."
W05-0408	P02-1053	o	"It is worth noting, however, that even in Turney (2002) the choice of seed words is explicitly motivated by domain properties of movie reviews."

H05-1027	P03-1021	o	"The modifications are made to deal with the efficiency issue due to the fact that there is a very large number of features and training samples in our task, compared to only 8 features used in (Och 2003)."

H05-1095	P03-1021	o	"1 Introduction Possibly the most remarkable evolution of recent years in statistical machine translation is the step from word-based models to phrase-based models (Och et al. , 1999; Marcu and Wong, 2002; Yamada and Knight, 2002; Tillmann and Xia, 2003)."
H05-1096	P03-1021	o	"Nowadays, most of the state-of-the-art SMT systems are based on bilingual phrases (Bertoldi et al. , 2004; Koehn et al. , 2003; Och and Ney, 2004; Tillmann, 2003; Vogel et al. , 2004; Zens and Ney, 2004)."

H05-1098	P03-1021	o	"5 Analysis Over the last few years, several automatic metrics for machine translation evaluation have been introduced, largely to reduce the human cost of iterative system evaluation during the development cycle (Lin and Och, 2004; Melamed et al. , 2003; Papineni et al. , 2002)."
I05-2039	P03-1021	o	"It has a lower bound of 0, no upper bound, better scores indicate better translations, and it tends to be highly correlated with the adequacy of outputs ;  mWER (Och 2003) or Multiple Word Error Rate is the edit distance in words between the system output and the closest reference translation in a set."
I08-1030	P03-1021	o	"2 Phrase-based statistical machine translation Phrase-based SMT uses a framework of log-linear models (Och, 2003) to integrate multiple features."

I08-2088	P03-1021	o	"3.2.2 Features We used eight features (Och and Ney, 2003; Koehn et al., 2003) and their weights for the translations."
I08-2088	P03-1021	p	"Target language model probability (weight = 0.5) According to a previous study, the minimum error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003), which is the optimization of feature weights by maximizing the BLEU score on the development set, can improve the performance of a system."
I08-4028	P03-1021	o	"The decision rule here is: W 0 = argmax W {Pr(W|C)} = argmax W { M summationdisplay m=1  m h m (W, C)} (3) The parameters  M 1 of this model can be optimized by standard approaches, such as the Minimum Error Rate Training used in machine translation (Och, 2003)."

J04-4002	P03-1021	o	"Looking at the results of the recent machine translation evaluations, this approach seems currently to give the best results, and an increasing number of researchers are working on different methods for learning phrase translation lexica for machine translation purposes (Marcu and Wong 2002; Venugopal, Vogel, and Waibel 2003; Tillmann 2003; Koehn, Och, and Marcu 2003)."
J04-4002	P03-1021	o	An alternative training criterion therefore directly optimizes translation quality as measured by an automatic evaluation criterion (Och 2003).

J04-4002	P03-1021	o	"The alignment a J 1 that has the highest probability (under a certain model) is also called the Viterbi alignment (of that model): a J 1 = argmax a J 1 p   (f J 1, a J 1 | e I 1 ) (8) A detailed comparison of the quality of these Viterbi alignments for various statistical alignment models compared to human-made word alignments can be found in Och and Ney (2003)."
J05-4003	P03-1021	o	"Using this alignment strategy, we follow (Och and Ney 2003) and compute one alignment for each translation direction ( f  e and e  f ), and then combine them."
J05-4003	P03-1021	o	All our MT systems were trained using a variant of the alignment template model described in (Och 2003).
J05-4005	P03-1021	o	"It is also related to (log-)linear models described in Berger, Della Pietra, and Della Pietra (1996), Xue (2003); Och (2003), and Peng, Feng, and McCallum (2004)."

J07-1003	P03-1021	o	These weights or scaling factors can be optimized with respect to some evaluation criterion (Och 2003).
J07-1003	P03-1021	o	"Nowadays, most state-of-the-art SMT systems are based on bilingual phrases (Och, Tillmann, and Ney 1999; Koehn, Och, and Marcu 2003; Tillmann 2003; Bertoldi et al. 2004; Vogel et al. 2004; Zens and Ney 2004; Chiang 2005)."

J07-2003	P03-1021	o	"Finally, the parameters  i of the log-linear model (18) are learned by minimumerror-rate training (Och 2003), which tries to set the parameters so as to maximize the BLEU score (Papineni et al. 2002) of a development set."
J07-2003	P03-1021	o	"But Koehn, Och, and Marcu (2003) find that phrases longer than three words improve performance little for training corpora of up to 20 million words, suggesting that the data may be too sparse to learn longer phrases."
J07-2003	P03-1021	o	"Above the phrase level, some models perform no reordering (Zens and Ney 2004; Kumar, Deng, and Byrne 2006), some have a simple distortion model that reorders phrases independently of their content (Koehn, Och, and Marcu 2003; Och and Ney 2004), and some, for example, the Alignment Template System (Och et al. 2004; Thayer et al. 2004), hereafter ATS, and the IBM phrase-based system (Tillmann 2004; Tillmann and Zhang 2005), have phrase-reordering models that add some lexical sensitivity."

J07-2003	P03-1021	p	Other insights borrowed from the current state of the art include minimum-error-rate training of log-linear models (Och and Ney 2002; Och 2003) and use of an m-gram language model.
J07-3002	P03-1021	o	Some of the alignment sets also have links which are not Sure links but are Possible links (Och and Ney 2003).
J07-3002	P03-1021	o	"We also have an additional held-out translation set, the development set, which is employed by the MT system to train the weights of its log-linear model to maximize BLEU (Och 2003)."
J07-3002	P03-1021	o	"The training data for the French/English data set is taken from the LDC Canadian Hansard data set, from which the word aligned data (presented in Och and Ney 2003) was also taken."
J07-3002	P03-1021	o	"294 Fraser and Marcu Measuring Word Alignment Quality for Statistical Machine Translation 2.2 Measuring Translation Performance Changes Caused By Alignment In phrased-based SMT (Koehn, Och, and Marcu 2003) the knowledge sources which vary with the word alignment are the phrase translation lexicon (which maps source phrases to target phrases using counts from the word alignment) and some of the word level translation parameters (sometimes called lexical smoothing)."
J07-3002	P03-1021	o	"The weights of the different knowledge sources in the log-linear model used by our system are trained using Maximum BLEU (Och 2003), which we run for 25 iterations individually for each system."
J07-3002	P03-1021	o	"To generate word alignments we use GIZA++ (Och and Ney 2003), which implements both the IBM Models of Brown et al."
J07-3002	P03-1021	o	The output of GIZA++ is then post-processed using the three symmetrization heuristics described in Och and Ney (2003).
J07-3002	P03-1021	o	Word Alignment Quality Metrics 3.1 Alignment Error Rate is Not a Useful Measure We begin our study of metrics for word alignment quality by testing AER (Och and Ney 2003).
J07-3002	P03-1021	o	Och and Ney (2003) state that AER is derived from F-Measure.

N04-1023	P03-1021	o	Och (2003) described the use of minimum error training directly optimizing the error rate on automatic MT evaluation metrics such as BLEU.
N04-1023	P03-1021	o	"SMT Team (2003) also used minimum error training as in Och (2003), but used a large number of feature functions."
N04-1023	P03-1021	o	"By reranking a 1000-best list generated by the baseline MT system from Och (2003), the BLEU (Papineni et al. , 2001) score on the test dataset was improved from 31.6% to 32.9%."

We also view this as one of the key ideas of the incremental perceptron algorithm of (Collins and Roark, 2004), which searches through a complex decision space step-by-step and is immediately updated at the first wrong move."

D09-1127	P04-1015	o	"In shift-reduce parsing, further mistakes are often caused by previous ones, so only the first mistake in each sentence (if there is one) is easily identifiable;7 this is also the argument for early update in applying perceptron learning to these incremental parsing algorithms (Collins and Roark, 2004) (see also Section 2)."
D09-1127	P04-1015	o	"Following Collins and Roark (2004) we also use the early-update strategy, where an update happens whenever the goldstandard action-sequence falls off the beam, with the rest of the sequence neglected."

E09-3005	P07-1033	o	"The problem itself has started to get attention only recently (Roark and Bacchiani, 2003; Hara et al., 2005; Daume III and Marcu, 2006; Daume III, 2007; Blitzer et al., 2006; McClosky et al., 2006; Dredze et al., 2007)."
E09-3005	P07-1033	o	"We distinguish two main approaches to domain adaptation that have been addressed in the literature (Daume III, 2007): supervised and semi-supervised."
E09-3005	P07-1033	o	"In supervised domain adaptation (Gildea, 2001; Roark and Bacchiani, 2003; Hara et al., 2005; Daume III, 2007), besides the labeled source data, we have access to a comparably small, but labeled amount of target data."
E09-3005	P07-1033	p	"Studies on the supervised task have shown that straightforward baselines (e.g. models based on source only, target only, or the union of the data) achieve a relatively high performance level and are surprisingly difficult to beat (Daume III, 2007)."
E09-3005	P07-1033	o	"Thus, one conclusion from that line of work is that as soon as there is a reasonable (often even small) amount of labeled target data, it is often more fruitful to either just use that, or to apply simple adaptation techniques (Daume III, 2007; Plank and van Noord, 2008)."
E09-3005	P07-1033	o	"Therefore, whenever we have access to a large amount of labeled data from some source (out-of-domain), but we would like a model that performs well on some new target domain (Gildea, 2001; Daume III, 2007), we face the problem of domain adaptation."
I08-2097	P07-1033	o	"There are many possible methods for combining unlabeled and labeled data (Daume III, 2007), but we simply concatenate unlabeled data with labeled data to see the effectiveness of the selected reliable parses."

N09-1068	P07-1033	o	"Because Daume III (2007) views the adaptation as merely augmenting the feature space, each of his features has the same prior mean and variance, regardless of whether it is domain specific or independent."

N09-1068	P07-1033	o	"We also show that the domain adaptation work of (Daume III, 2007), which is presented as an ad-hoc preprocessing step, is actually equivalent to our formal model."
N09-1068	P07-1033	o	"However, our representation of the model conceptually separates some of the hyperparameters which are not separated in (Daume III, 2007), and we found that setting these hyperparameters with different values from one another was critical for improving performance."
N09-1068	P07-1033	o	"We show that the method of (Daume III, 2007), which was presented as a simple preprocessing step, is actually equivalent, except our representation explicitly separates hyperparameters which were tied in his work."
N09-1068	P07-1033	o	"We demonstrate that allowing different values for these hyperparameters significantly improves performance over both a strong baseline and (Daume III, 2007) within both a conditional random field sequence model for named entity recognition and a discriminatively trained dependency parser."
N09-1068	P07-1033	o	"2.4 Formalization of (Daume III, 2007) As mentioned earlier, our model is equivalent to that presented in (Daume III, 2007), and can be viewed as a formal version of his model.2 In his presentation, the adapation is done through feature augmentation."
N09-1068	P07-1033	o	"Recall that the log likelihood of our model is:  d parenleftBigg Lorig(Dd;d) i (d,i ,i)2 2 2d parenrightBigg  i (,i)2 2 2 We now introduce a new variable d = d , and plug it into the equation for log likelihood:  d parenleftBigg Lorig(Dd;d +) i (d,i)2 2 2d parenrightBigg  i (,i)2 2 2 The result is the model of (Daume III, 2007), where the d are the domain-specific feature weights, and d are the domain-independent feature weights."
P08-1029	P07-1033	o	"Other techniques have tried to quantify the generalizability of certain features across domains (Daume III and Marcu, 2006; Jiang and Zhai, 2006), or tried to exploit the common structure of related problems (Ben-David et al., 2007; Scholkopf et al., 2005)."
P08-1029	P07-1033	o	"Daume allows an extra degree of freedom among the features of his domains, implicitly creating a two-level feature hierarchy with one branch for general features, and another for domain specific ones, but does not extend his hierarchy further (Daume III, 2007))."
P09-1056	P07-1033	o	"Unlike our technique, in most cases researchers have focused on the scenario where labeled training data is available in both the source and the target domain (e.g., (Daume III, 2007; Chelba and Acero, 2004; Daume III and Marcu, 2006))."
P09-1059	P07-1033	o	"(2006) and Daume III (2007) (and see below for discussions), so in this paper we focus on the less studied, but equally important problem of annotationstyle adaptation."
P09-1059	P07-1033	o	"This method is very similar to some ideas in domain adaptation (Daume III and Marcu, 2006; Daume III, 2007), but we argue that the underlying problems are quite different."

P09-1087	P07-1033	p	"For example, (Daume III, 2007) shows that training a learning algorithm on the weighted union of different data sets (which is basically what we did) performs almost as well as more involved domain adaptation approaches."
P09-1114	P07-1033	o	"The model presented above is based on our previous work (Jiang and Zhai, 2007c), which bears the same spirit of some other recent work on multitask learning (Ando and Zhang, 2005; Evgeniou and Pontil, 2004; Daume III, 2007)."
P09-1114	P07-1033	o	"While transfer learning was proposed more than a decade ago (Thrun, 1996; Caruana, 1997), its application in natural language processing is still a relatively new territory (Blitzer et al., 2006; Daume III, 2007; Jiang and Zhai, 2007a; Arnold et al., 2008; Dredze and Crammer, 2008), and its application in relation extraction is still unexplored."
P09-1114	P07-1033	o	Daume III (2007) proposed a simple feature augmentation method to achieve domain adaptation.
P09-2079	P07-1033	o	"Also, the aspect of generalizing features across different products is closely related to fully supervised domain adaptation (Daume III, 2007), and we plan to combine our approach with the idea from Daume III (2007) to gain insights into whether the composite back-off features exhibit different behavior in domain-general versus domain-specific feature sub-spaces."
W09-2420	P07-1033	o	"Differences in behavior of WSD systems when applied to lexical-sample and all-words datasets have been observed on previous Senseval and Semeval competitions (Kilgarriff, 2001; Mihalcea et al., 2004; Pradhan et al., 2007): supervised systems attain results on the high 80s and beat the most frequent baseline by a large margin for lexical-sample datasets, but results on the all-words datasets were much more modest, on the low 70s, and a few points above the most frequent baseline."
W09-2420	P07-1033	o	"1 Introduction Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) competitions have focused on general domain texts, as attested in the last Senseval and Semeval competitions (Kilgarriff, 2001; Mihalcea et al., 2004; Pradhan et al., 2007)."

E09-3005	P07-1056	o	"So far, SCL has been applied successfully in NLP for Part-of-Speech tagging and Sentiment Analysis (Blitzer et al., 2006; Blitzer et al., 2007)."

P09-1027	P07-1056	o	"Training Set (Labeled English Reviews): There are many labeled English corpora available on the Web and we used the corpus constructed for multi-domain sentiment classification (Blitzer et al., 2007) 9 , because the corpus was large-scale and it was within similar domains as the test set."

D07-1099	P07-1080	o	"ISBNs, originally proposed for constituent parsing in (Titov and Henderson, 2007a), use vectors of binary latent variables to encode information about the parse history."

D07-1099	P07-1080	o	"As was demonstrated in (Titov and Henderson, 2007b), even a minimal set of local explicit features achieves results which are non-significantly different from a carefully chosen set of explicit features, given the language independent definition of locality described in section 2."

W07-2218	P07-1080	p	"As discussed in (Titov and Henderson, 2007), computing the conditional probabilities which we need for parsing is in general intractable with ISBNs, but they can be approximated efficiently in several ways."
W07-2218	P07-1080	o	"We expect that the mean field approximation should demonstrate better results than feed-forward approximation on this task as it is theoretically expected and confirmed on the constituent parsing task (Titov and Henderson, 2007)."

W07-2218	P07-1080	o	"The second approximation proposed in (Titov and Henderson, 2007) takes into consideration the fact that, after each decision is made, all the preceding latent variables should have their means i updated."

D09-1079	P08-1058	o	Talbot and Brants (2008) used a Bloomier filter to encode a LM.
D09-1079	P08-1058	o	"The Bloomier filter LM (Talbot and Brants, 2008) has a precomputed matching of keys shared between a constant number of cells in the filter array."

D09-1008	P08-1066	o	"Due to the lack of a good Arabic parser compatible with the Sakhr tokenization that we used on the source side, we did not test the source dependency LM for Arabic-to-English MT. When extracting rules with source dependency structures, we applied the same well-formedness constraint on the source side as we did on the target side, using a procedure described by (Shen et al., 2008)."

H05-1017	P95-1026	o	"Within the machine learning paradigm, IL has been incorporated as a technique for bootstrapping an extensional learning algorithm, as in (Yarowsky, 1995; Collins and Singer, 1999; Liu et al. , 2004)."
H05-1017	P95-1026	o	"It is possible to recognize a common structure of these works, based on a typical bootstrap schema (Yarowsky, 1995; Collins and Singer, 1999): Step 1: Initial unsupervised categorization."
H05-1046	P95-1026	o	"There has of course been a large amount of work on the more general problem of word-sense disambiguation, e.g., (Yarowsky 1995) (Kilgarriff and Edmonds 2002)."
H05-1050	P95-1026	o	"We extracted all examples of each word from the 14-million-word English portion of the Hansards.8 Note that this is considerably smaller than Yarowskys (1995) corpus of 460 million words, so bootstrapping will not perform as well, and may be more sensitive to the choice of seed."
H05-1050	P95-1026	o	"In the supervised condition, we used just 2 additional task instances, plant and tank, each with 4000 handannotated instances drawn from a large balanced corpus (Yarowsky, 1995)."
H05-1050	P95-1026	n	"6 Conclusions In this paper, we showed that it is sometimes possible indeed, preferableto eliminate the initial bit of supervision in bootstrapping algorithms such as the Yarowsky (1995) algorithm for word sense disambiguation."
H05-1050	P95-1026	p	2.1 The Yarowsky algorithm Yarowsky (1995) sparked considerable interest in bootstrapping with his successful method for word sense disambiguation.
H05-1050	P95-1026	n	"Our experiments on the Canadian Hansards show that our unsupervised technique is significantly more effective than picking seeds by hand (Yarowsky, 1995), which in turn is known to rival supervised methods."
H05-1107	P95-1026	o	Yarowsky (1995) used this method for word sense disambiguation.
H05-1114	P95-1026	o	"Many corpus based statistical methods have been proposed to solve this problem, including supervised learning algorithms (Leacock et al. , 1998; Towel and Voorheest, 1998), weakly supervised learning algorithms (Dagan and Itai, 1994; Li and Li, 2004; Mihalcea, 2004; Niu et al. , 2005; Park et al. , 2000; Yarowsky, 1995), unsupervised learning algorithms (or word sense discrimination) (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997; Schutze, 1998), and knowledge based algorithms (Lesk, 1986; McCarthy et al. , 2004)."
I05-3009	P95-1026	o	"It is appreciated that multi-sense words appearing in the same document tend to be tagged with the same word sense if they belong to the same common domain in the semantic hierarchy (Yarowsky, 1995)."
I08-1040	P95-1026	o	But it is close to the paradigm described by Yarowsky (1995) and Turney (2002) as it also employs self-training based on a relatively small seed data set which is incrementally enlarged with unlabelled samples.
J01-3001	P95-1026	o	Yarowsky (1995) dealt with this problem largely by producing an unsupervised learning algorithm that generates probabilistic decision list models of word senses from seed collocates.
J01-3001	P95-1026	o	"Currently, machine learning methods (Yarowsky 1995; Rigau, Atserias, and Agirre 1997) and combinations of classifiers (McRoy 1992) have been popular."
J01-3001	P95-1026	o	"Some researchers have concentrated on producing WSD systems that base results on a limited number of words, for example Yarowsky (1995) and Schtitze (1992) who quoted results for 12 words, and a second group, including Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees (1993) and Bruce and Wiebe (1994), who gave results for just one, namely interest."
J01-3001	P95-1026	o	"(1991), Yarowsky (1995) and others."
J02-3002	P95-1026	o	"Since then this idea has been applied to several tasks, including word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky 1995) and named-entity recognition (Cucerzan and Yarowsky 1999)."
J03-3002	P95-1026	o	"This approach to minimally supervised classifier construction has been widely studied (Yarowsky 1995), especially in cases in which the features of interest are orthogonal in some sense (e.g. , Blum and Mitchell 1998; Abney 2002)."
J04-1001	P95-1026	o	Yarowsky (1995) has proposed a bootstrapping method for word sense disambiguation.
J04-1001	P95-1026	o	This implementation is exactly the one proposed in Yarowsky (1995).
J04-1001	P95-1026	o	"We viewed the seed word as a classified sentence, following a similar proposal in Yarowsky (1995)."
J04-1001	P95-1026	o	4.4 Experiment 2: Yarowskys Words We also conducted translation on seven of the twelve English words studied in Yarowsky (1995).
J04-1001	P95-1026	o	"Note that the results of MB-D here cannot be directly compared with those in Yarowsky (1995), because the data used are different."
J04-1001	P95-1026	o	"Yarowsky (1995) proposed such a method for word sense disambiguation, which we refer to as monolingual bootstrapping."
J04-1001	P95-1026	o	"After line 17, we can employ the one-sense-per-discourse heuristic to further classify unclassified data, as proposed in Yarowsky (1995)."
J04-1003	P95-1026	p	"A variety of classifiers have been employed for this task (see Mooney [1996] and Ide and Veronis [1998] for overviews), the most popular being decision lists (Yarowsky 1994, 1995) and naive Bayesian classifiers (Pedersen 2000; Ng 1997; Pedersen and Bruce 1998; Mooney 1996; Cucerzan and Yarowsky 2002)."
J04-3004	P95-1026	p	The Yarowsky (1995) algorithm was one of the first bootstrapping algorithms to become widely known in computational linguistics.
J06-2003	P95-1026	o	The algorithm we implemented is inspired by the work of Yarowsky (1995) on word sense disambiguation.
J98-1001	P95-1026	o	"(1992), Pereira and Tishby (1992), and Pereira, Tishby, and Lee (1993) propose methods that derive classes from the distributional properties of the corpus itself, while other authors use external information sources to define classes: Resnik (1992) uses the taxonomy of WordNet; Yarowsky (1992) uses the categories of Roget's Thesaurus, Slator (1992) and Liddy and Paik (1993) use the subject codes in the LDOCE; Luk (1995) uses conceptual sets built from the LDOCE definitions."
J98-1001	P95-1026	o	"Aware of this problem, Resnik and Yarowsky suggest creating the sense distance matrix based on results in experimental psychology such as Miller and Charles (1991) or Resnik (1995b)."

J98-1003	P95-1026	o	"Lacking an automatic method, recent WSD works (Bruce and Wiebe 1995; Luk 1995; Yarowsky 1995) still resort to human intervention to identify and group closely related senses in an MRD."
J98-1003	P95-1026	o	Using thesaurus categories directly as a coarse sense division may seem to be a viable alternative (Yarowsky 1995).
J98-1003	P95-1026	o	TopSense is tested on 20 words extensively investigated in recent WSD literature (Schi~tze 1992; Yarowsky 1992; Luk 1995).
J98-1004	P95-1026	o	The fact that the error rate more than doubles when the seeds in Yarowsky's (1995) experiments are reduced from a sense's best collocations to just one word per sense suggests that the error rate would increase further if no seeds were provided.
J98-1004	P95-1026	p	Yarowsky has proposed an algorithm that requires as little user input as one seed word per sense to start the training process (Yarowsky 1995).
J98-1005	P95-1026	o	"At each training-set size, a new copy of the network is trained under each of the following conditions: (1) using SULU, (2) using SULU but supplying only the labeled training examples to synthesize, (3) standard network training, (4) using a re-implementation of an algorithm proposed by Yarowsky (1995), and (5) using standard network training but with all training examples labeled to establish an upper bound."
J98-1006	P95-1026	o	Several artificial techniques have been used so that classifiers can be developed and tested without having to invest in manually tagging the data: Yarowsky (1993) and Sch/itze (1995) have acquired training and testing materials by creating pseudowords from existing nonhomographic forms.
J98-1006	P95-1026	o	"Yarowsky (1995) has proposed automatically augmenting a small set of experimenter-supplied seed collocations (e.g. , manufacturing plant and plant life for two different senses of the noun plant) into a much larger set of training materials."
J98-4002	P95-1026	o	"Various corpus-based approaches to word sense disambiguation have been proposed (Bruce and Wiebe 1994; Charniak 1993; Dagan and Itai 1994; Fujii et al. 1996; Hearst 1991; Karov and Edelman 1996; Kurohashi and Nagao 1994; Li, Szpakowicz, and Matwin 1995; Ng and Lee 1996; Niwa and Nitta 1994; Sch~itze 1992; Uramoto 1994b; Yarowsky 1995)."

W09-1705	P95-1026	o	"We observe that the tagging method exploits the one sense per collocation property (Yarowsky, 1995), which means that WSD based on collocations is probably finer than WSD based on simple words, since ambiguity is reduced (Klapaftis and Manandhar, 2008)."

W03-0401	P97-1003	o	"However, existing models of disambiguation with lexicalized grammars are a mere extension of lexicalized probabilistic context-free grammars (LPCFG) (Collins, 1996; Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997), which are based on the decomposition of parsing results into the syntactic/semantic dependencies of two words in a sentence under the assumption of independence of the dependencies."
W03-0401	P97-1003	o	"Since an existing study incorporates these relations ad hoc (Collins, 1997), they are apparently crucial in accurate disambiguation."

We also view this as one of the key ideas of the incremental perceptron algorithm of (Collins and Roark, 2004), which searches through a complex decision space step-by-step and is immediately updated at the first wrong move."

N03-1028	W02-1001	o	"3.3 Voted Perceptron Unlike other methods discussed so far, voted perceptron training (Collins, 2002) attempts to minimize the difference between the global feature vector for a training instance and the same feature vector for the best-scoring labeling of that instance according to the current model."
N03-1028	W02-1001	o	"Instead of taking just the nal weight vector, the voted perceptron algorithm takes the average of the t. Collins (2002) reported and we con rmed that this averaging reduces overtting considerably."

W06-0301	W02-1011	o	"Identifying subjectivity helps separate opinions from fact, which may be useful in question answering, summarization, etc. Sentiment detection is the task of determining positive or negative sentiment of words (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney, 2002; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005), phrases and sentences (Kim and Hovy, 2004; Wilson et al. , 2005), or documents (Pang et al. , 2002; Turney, 2002)."
W06-0305	W02-1011	o	"Most of the annotation approaches tackling these issues, however, are aimed at performing classifications at either the document level (Pang et al. , 2002; Turney, 2002), or the sentence or word level (Wiebe et al. , 2004; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003)."
W06-0306	W02-1011	o	"In analyzing opinions (Cardie et al. , 2003; Wilson et al. , 2004), judging document-level subjectivity (Pang et al. , 2002; Turney, 2002), and answering opinion questions (Cardie et al. , 2003; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003), the output of a sentence-level subjectivity classification can be used without modification."
W06-1639	W02-1011	o	"In particular, since we treat each individual speech within a debate as a single document, we are considering a version of document-level sentiment-polarity classification, namely, automatically distinguishing between positive and negative documents (Das and Chen, 2001; Pang et al. , 2002; Turney, 2002; Dave et al. , 2003)."
W06-1639	W02-1011	o	"3.2 Classifying speech segments in isolation In our experiments, we employed the well-known classifier SVMlight to obtain individual-document classification scores, treating Y as the positive class and using plain unigrams as features.5 Following standard practice in sentiment analysis (Pang et al. , 2002), the input to SVMlight consisted of normalized presence-of-feature (rather than frequency-of-feature) vectors."
W06-1641	W02-1011	o	"This negation handling is similar to that used in (Das and Chen, 2001; Pang et al. , 2002)."
W06-1641	W02-1011	n	"A number of studies have investigated sentiment classification at document level, e.g., (Pang et al. , 2002; Dave et al. , 2003), and at sentence level, e.g., (Hu and Liu, 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Nigam and Hurst, 2005); however, the accuracy is still less than desirable."

W07-0714	W05-0904	o	"These dependencies differ from those used by Liu and Gildea (2005), in that they are extracted according to the rules of the LFG grammar and they are labelled with a type of grammatical relation that connects the head and the modifier, such as subject, determiner, etc. The presence of grammatical relation labels adds another layer of important linguistic information into the comparison and allows us to account for partial matches, for example when a lexical item finds itself in a correct relation but with an incorrect partner."

P09-1053	W06-3104	o	"Following Smith and Eisner (2006), we adopt the view that the syntactic structure of sentences paraphrasing some sentence s should be inspired by the structure of s. Because dependency syntax is still only a crude approximation to semantic structure, we augment the model with a lexical semantics component, based on WordNet (Miller, 1995), that models how words are probabilistically altered in generating a paraphrase."

P99-1067	W93-0113	o	"However, in yet unpublished work we found that at least for the computation of synonyms and related words neither syntactical analysis nor singular value decomposition lead to significantly better results than the approach described here when applied to the monolingual case (see also Grefenstette, 1993), so we did not try to include these methods in our system."
W04-2103	W93-0113	o	"Grefenstette (1993) studied two context delineation methods of English nouns: the window-based and the syntactic, whereby all the different types of syntactic dependencies of the nouns were used in the same feature space."

N03-1035	W95-0107	o	NP chunks (Abney 1991; Ramshaw and Marcus 1995; Evans and Zhai 1996; Frantzi and Ananiadou 1996) and technical terms (Dagan and Church 1994; Justeson and Katz 1995; Daille 1996; Jacquemin 2001; Bourigault et al. 2002) fall into this difficult-toassess category.
N03-1035	W95-0107	o	"To evaluate the performance of a parser, NP chunks can usefully be evaluated by a gold standard; many systems (e.g. , Ramshaw and Marcus 1995 and Cardie and Pierce 1988) use the Penn Treebank for this type of evaluation."

N04-1005	W95-0107	o	"These tags are drawn from a tagset which is constructed by extending each argument label by three additional symbols a11 a24 a35 a24a4a12, following (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995)."

W06-0112	W95-0107	o	Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) introduced a transformationbased learning method which considered chunking as a kind of tagging problem.
W06-0112	W95-0107	o	2 Task Description 2.1 Data Representation Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) gave mainly two kinds of base NPs representation  the open/close bracketing and IOB tagging.
W06-0113	W95-0107	o	Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) first introduced the machine learning techniques to chunking problem.
W06-0113	W95-0107	o	"6 Related works After the work of Ramshaw and Marcus (1995), many machine learning techniques have been applied to the basic chunking task, such as Support Vector Machines (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001), Hidden Markov Model(Molina and Pla 2002), Memory Based Learning (Sang, 2002), Conditional Random Fields (Sha and Pereira, 2003), and so on."
W06-0139	W95-0107	o	"2.1 Word Sequence Classification Similar to English text chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995; Wu et al. , 2006a), the word sequence classification model aims to classify each word via encoding its context features."
W06-0505	W95-0107	o	"The sentences in the training and testing sets were already (perfectly) POS-tagged and noun chunked, and that in a real-life situation additional preprocessing by a POS-tagger (such as the LT-POS-tagger4) and noun chunker (such as described in (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995)) which will introduce additional errors."

W07-0812	W95-0107	o	"Moreover, since BPC had been cast as a classification problem by Ramshaw and Marcus (1995), the task is performed with greater efficiency and is easily portable to new languages in a supervised manner (Diab et al. , 2004; Diab et al. , 2007)."
W07-0812	W95-0107	o	"It was first cast as a classification problem by Ramshaw and Marcus (1995), as a problem of NP chunking."
W07-0812	W95-0107	o	"A la Ramshaw and Marcus (1995), they represent the words as a sequence of labeled words with IOB annotations, where the B marks a word at the beginning of a chunk, I marks a word inside a chunk, and O marks those words (and punctuation) that are outside chunks."
W07-0812	W95-0107	o	"A la Ramshaw and Marcus (1995), and Kudo and Matsumato (2000), we use the IOB tagging style for modeling and classification."
W07-1009	W95-0107	o	"The difficulty of this task is that the standard method for converting NER to a sequence tagging problem with BIOencoding (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995), where each 1http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/ace/ index.htm token is assigned a tag to indicate whether it is at the beginning (B), inside (I), or outside (O) of an entity, is not directly applicable when tokens belong to more than one entity."
W07-1022	W95-0107	o	"The concept of baseNP has undergone a number of revisions (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995; Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000) but has previously always been tied to extraction from a more completely annotated treebank, whose annotations are subject to other pressures than just initial material up to the head . To our knowledge, our gures for inter-annotator agreement on the baseNP task itself 169 (i.e. not derived from a larger annotation task) are the rst to be reported."
W07-1022	W95-0107	o	"Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) state that a baseNP aims to identify essentially the initial portions of nonrecursive noun phrases up to the head, including determiners but not including postmodifying prepositional phrases or clauses . However, work on baseNPs has essentially always proceeded via algorithmic extraction from fully parsed corpora such as the Penn Treebank."
W07-1022	W95-0107	o	"1 Introduction Base noun phrases (baseNPs), broadly the initial portions of non-recursive noun phrases up to the head (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995), are valuable pieces of linguistic structure which minimally extend beyond the scope of named entities."
W07-1509	W95-0107	o	"Given a weight vector w, the score wf(x,y) ranks possible labelings of x, and we denote by Yk,w(x) the set of k top scoring labelings for x. We use the standard B,I,O encoding for named entities (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995)."
W08-0113	W95-0107	o	"We hence chose transformation-based learning to create this (shallow) segmentation grammar, converting the segmentation task into a tagging task (as is done in 85 (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995), inter alia)."
W08-0113	W95-0107	o	"Apart from this, the module is a straightforward implementation of (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995), which in turn adapts (Brill, 1993) for syntactic chunking."
W09-1317	W95-0107	o	"4.4 Text chunking Next, a rule-based text chunker (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) is applied on the tagged sentences to further identify phrasal units, such as base noun phrases NP and verbal units VB."
W09-1412	W95-0107	o	"All our experiments used the standard BIO encoding (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) with different feature sets and learning procedures."

W99-0621	W95-0107	o	"We do not consider mixed features between words and POS tags as in (l:tamshaw and Marcus, 1995), that is, a single feature consists of either words or tags."
W99-0621	W95-0107	o	"4 Methodology 4.1 Data In order to be able to compare our results with the results obtained by other researchers, we worked with the same data sets already used by (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995; Argamon et al. , 1998) for NP and SV detection."
W99-0621	W95-0107	o	"Instead of using the NP bracketing information present in the tagged Treebank data, Ramshaw and Marcus modified the data so as to include bracketing information related only to the non-recursive, base NPs present in each sentence while the subject verb phrases were taken as is. The data sets include POS tag information generated by Ramshaw and Marcus using Brill's transformational part-of-speech tagger (Brill, 1995)."
W99-0621	W95-0107	o	"The results are comparable to other results reported using the Inside/Outside method (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) (see Table 7."
W99-0621	W95-0107	o	"This is similar to results in the literature (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995)."
W99-0621	W95-0107	o	"Perhaps this was not observed earlier since (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) studied only base NPs, most of which are short."
W99-0621	W95-0107	o	"These problems formulations are similar to those studied in (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) and (Church, 1988; Argamon et al. , 1998), respectively."
W99-0621	W95-0107	o	"Of the several slightly different definitions of a base NP in the literature we use for the purposes of this work the definition presented in (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) and used also by (Argamon et al. , 1998)and others."
W99-0621	W95-0107	o	"For example, the sentence I went to California last May would be marked for base NPs as: I went to California last May I 0 0 I B I indicating that the NPs are I, California and last May. This approach has been studied in (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995)."
W99-0621	W95-0107	o	"The observation that shallow syntactic information can be extracted using local information by examining the pattern itself, its nearby context and the local part-of-speech information has motivated the use of learning methods to recognize these patterns (Church, 1988; Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995; Argamon et al. , 1998; Cardie and Pierce, 1998)."
W99-0629	W95-0107	o	"Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) first assigned a chunk tag to each word in the sentence: I for inside a chunk, O for outside a chunk, and 240 type precision B tbr inside a chunk, but tile preceding word is in another chunk."
W99-0705	W95-0107	o	"Introduction Since Eric Brill first introduced the method of Transformation-Based Learning (TBL) it has been used to learn rules for many natural language processing tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging \[Brill, 1995\], PPattachment disambiguation \[Brill and Resnik, 1994\], text chunking \[Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995\], spelling correction \[Mangu and Brill, 1997\], dialogue act tagging \[Samuel et al. , 1998\] and ellipsis resolution \[Hardt, 1998\]."
W99-0707	W95-0107	o	"Chunking For NP chunking, \[Argamon et al. , 1998\] used data extracted from section 15-18 of the WS.J as a fixed train set and section 20 as a fixed test set, the same data as \[Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995\]."
W99-0707	W95-0107	o	"Since part of the chunking errors could be caused by POS errors, we also compared the same baseNP chunker on the santo corpus tagged with i) the Brill tagger as used in \[Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995\], ii) the Memory-Based Tagger (MBT) as described in \[Daelemans et al. , 1996\]."
W99-0707	W95-0107	o	"We also present the results of \[Argamon et al. , 1998\], \[Ramshaw and Marcus: 1995\] and \[Cardie and Pierce, 1998\] in Table 4."
W99-0707	W95-0107	o	"Introduction Recently, there has been an increased interest in approaches to automatically learning to recognize shallow linguistic patterns in text \[Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995, Vilain and Day, 1996, Argamon et al. , 1998, Buchholz, 1998, Cardie and Pierce, 1998, Veenstra, 1998, Daelemans et aI."
A00-1031	W96-0213	p	"Recent comparisons of approaches that can be trained on corpora (van Halteren et al. , 1998; Volk and Schneider, 1998) have shown that in most cases statistical aproaches (Cutting et al. , 1992; Schmid, 1995; Ratnaparkhi, 1996) yield better results than finite-state, rule-based, or memory-based taggers (Brill, 1993; Daelemans et al. , 1996)."
A00-1031	W96-0213	n	"For the Penn Treebank, (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) reports an accuracy of 96.6% using the Maximum Entropy approach, our much simpler and therefore faster HMM approach delivers 96.7%."
A00-1031	W96-0213	o	"According to current tagger comparisons (van Halteren et al. , 1998; Zavrel and Daelemans, 1999), and according to a comparsion of the results presented here with those in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), the Maximum Entropy framework seems to be the only other approach yielding comparable results to the one presented here."
A00-1031	W96-0213	o	"The Penn Treebank results reported here for the Markov model approach are at least equivalent to those reported for the Maximum Entropy approach in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996)."
A00-2013	W96-0213	o	"1 Full Morphological Tagging English Part of Speech (POS) tagging has been widely described in the recent past, starting with the (Church, 1988) paper, followed by numerous others using various methods: neural networks (Julian Benello and Anderson, 1989), HMM tagging (Merialdo, 1992), decision trees (Schmid, 1994), transformation-based error-driven learning (Brill, 1995), and maximum entropy (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), to select just a few."
A00-2013	W96-0213	o	"This is the way the Maximum Entropy tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) runs if one uses the binary version from the website (see the comparison in Section 5)."
A00-2013	W96-0213	p	"We have chosen the Maximum Entropy tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) for a comparison with our universal tagger, since it achieved (by a small margin) the best overall result on Slovene as reported there (86.360% on all tokens) of taggers available to us (MBT, the best overall, was not freely available to us at the time of writing)."
A00-2020	W96-0213	o	Adwait Ratnaparkhi (1996) estimates a probability distribution for tagging using a maximum entropy approach.
A00-2020	W96-0213	o	"Regarding error detection in corpora, Ratnaparkhi (1996) discusses inconsistencies in the Penn Treebank and relates them to interannotator differences in tagging style."

C00-1082	W96-0213	p	"a.2 Maximum-entropy method The maximum-entropy method is useful with sparse data conditions and has been used by many researchers (Berger et al. , 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Borthwick el; al. , 1998; Uchimoto et al. , 1999)."
C00-2089	W96-0213	o	"We can find some other machine-learning approaches that use more sophisticated LMs, such as Decision Trees (Mhrquez and Rodrfguez, 1998)(Magerman, 1996), memory-based approaclms to learn special decision trees (Daelemans et al. , 1996), maximmn entropy approaches that combine statistical information from different sources (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), finite state autonmt2 inferred using Grammatical Inference (Pla and Prieto, 1998), etc. The comparison among different al)t)roaches is dif ficult due to the nmltiple factors that can be eonsid614 ered: tile languagK, tile mmfl)er and tyt)e of the tags, the size of tilt vocabulary, thK ambiguity, the diiticulty of the test ski, Kte."

C02-1101	W96-0213	o	"Many studies and improvements have been conducted for  Presently with Service Media Laboratory, Corporate ResearchandDevelopmentCenter, OkiElectricIndustry Co. ,Ltd. POS tagging, and major methods of POS tagging achieve an accuracy of 9697% on the Penn Treebank WSJ corpus, but obtaining higher accuracies is difficult (Ratnaparkhi, 1996)."
C02-1101	W96-0213	o	"It is mentioned that the limitation is largely caused by inconsistencies in the corpus (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Padro and M`arquez, 1998; van Halteren et al. , 2001)."
C02-1101	W96-0213	o	"For example, many statistical part-of-speech (POS) taggers have been developed and they use corpora as the training data to obtain statistical information or rules (Brill, 1995; Ratnaparkhi, 1996)."
C02-1145	W96-0213	o	Our POS tagger is essentially the maximum entropy tagger by Ratnaparkhi (1996) retrained on the CTB-I data.
C04-1040	W96-0213	o	"According to the document, it is the output of Ratnaparkhis tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996)."

C04-1134	W96-0213	o	"We use two state-of-the-art POS taggersa maximum entropy based English POS tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), and an HMM based Chinese POS tagger."
C04-1140	W96-0213	o	"Second, several tagging experiments on newspaper language, whether statistical (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Brants, 2000) or rule-based (Brill, 1995), report that the tagging accuracy for unknown words is much lower than the overall accuracy.2 Thus, the lower percentage of unknown words in medical texts seems to be a sublanguage feature beneficial to POS taggers, whereas the higher proportion of unknown words in newspaper language seems to be a prominent source of tagging errors."
C08-1106	W96-0213	o	"To accommodate multiple overlapping features on observations, some other approaches view the sequence labeling problem as a sequence of classification problems, including support vector machines (SVMs) (Kudo & Matsumoto 2001) and a variety of other classifiers (Punyakanok & Roth 2001; Abney et al. 1999; Ratnaparkhi 1996)."
D07-1003	W96-0213	o	"We tokenized sentences using the standard treebank tokenization script, and then we performed part-of-speech tagging using MXPOST tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996)."
D07-1041	W96-0213	o	"In contrast, the C&C tagger, which is based on that of Ratnaparkhi (1996), utilizes a wide range of features and a larger contextual window including the previous two tags and the two previous and two following words."
D07-1086	W96-0213	o	"We then tagged the search queries using a maximum entropy part-of-speech tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996)."

J07-4004	W96-0213	p	A key component of the parsing system is a Maximum Entropy CCG supertagger (Ratnaparkhi 1996; Curran and Clark 2003) which assigns lexical categories to words in a sentence.
J07-4004	W96-0213	o	"Related Work The first application of log-linear models to parsing is the work of Ratnaparkhi and colleagues (Ratnaparkhi, Roukos, and Ward 1994; Ratnaparkhi 1996, 1999)."

N03-1028	W96-0213	o	"The sequential classi cation approach can handle many correlated features, as demonstrated in work on maximum-entropy (McCallum et al. , 2000; Ratnaparkhi, 1996) and a variety of other linear classi ers, including winnow (Punyakanok and Roth, 2001), AdaBoost (Abney et al. , 1999), and support-vector machines (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001)."
N03-1033	W96-0213	o	"The per-state models in this paper are log-linear models, building upon the models in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) and (Toutanova and Manning, 2000), though some models are in fact strictly simpler."
N03-1033	W96-0213	o	"High-performance taggers typically also include joint three-tag counts in some way, either as tag trigrams (Brants, 2000) or tag-triple features (Ratnaparkhi, 1996, Toutanova and Manning, 2000)."

N03-1033	W96-0213	o	"At any rate, regularized conditional loglinear models have not previously been applied to the problem of producing a high quality part-of-speech tagger: Ratnaparkhi (1996), Toutanova and Manning (2000), and Collins (2002) all present unregularized models."
N03-1033	W96-0213	o	"Whereas Ratnaparkhi (1996) used feature support cutoffs and early stopping to stop overfitting of the model, and Collins (2002) contends that including low support features harms a maximum entropy model, our results show that low support features are useful in a regularized maximum entropy model."
N03-1033	W96-0213	o	"2 Bidirectional Dependency Networks When building probabilistic models for tag sequences, we often decompose the global probability of sequences using a directed graphical model (e.g. , an HMM (Brants, 2000) or a conditional Markov model (CMM) (Ratnaparkhi, 1996))."
N03-2003	W96-0213	o	"We then piped the text through a maximum entropy sentence boundary detector (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) and performed text normalization using NSW tools (Sproat et al, 2001)."

N04-1013	W96-0213	o	"For example, since the Collins parser depends on a prior part-of-speech tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), we included the time for POS tagging in our Collins measurements."

W00-1308	W96-0213	o	1 The Baseline Maximum Entropy Model We started with a maximum entropy based tagger that uses features very similar to the ones proposed in Ratnaparkhi (1996).
W00-1308	W96-0213	n	"Ratnaparkhi (1996: 134) suggests use of an approximation summing over the training data, which does not sum over possible tags: "" h E f j = 2 P( ~)p(ti l hi)f j(hi,ti) i=1 However, we believe this passage is in error: such an estimate is ineffective in the iterative scaling algorithm."
W00-1308	W96-0213	o	The features that define the constraints on the model are obtained by instantiation of feature templates as in Ratnaparkhi (1996).
W00-1308	W96-0213	o	They are a subset of the features used in Ratnaparkhi (1996).
W00-1308	W96-0213	p	"Among recent top performing methods are Hidden Markov Models (Brants 2000), maximum entropy approaches (Ratnaparkhi 1996), and transformation-based learning (Brill 1994)."

W00-1308	W96-0213	o	"This may stem from the differences between the two models' feature templates, thresholds, and approximations of the expected values for the features, as discussed in the beginning of the section, or may just reflect differences in the choice of training and test sets (which are not precisely specified in Ratnaparkhi (1996))."
W00-1308	W96-0213	n	One conclusion that we can draw is that at present the additional word features used in Ratnaparkhi (1996) looking at words more than one position away from the current do not appear to be helping the overall performance of the models.
W00-1308	W96-0213	n	"Some are the result of inconsistency in labeling in the training data (Ratnaparkhi 1996), which usually reflects a lack of linguistic clarity or determination of the correct part of speech in context."

W03-1201	W96-0213	o	"We used MXPOST (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), a maximum entropy based POS tagger."
W03-1728	W96-0213	o	"The Maximum Entropy Markov Model used in POS-tagging is described in detail in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) and the LMR tagger here uses the same probability model."
W03-2909	W96-0213	p	"This approach allows to combine strengths of generality of context attributes as in n-gram models (Brants, 2000; Megyesi, 2001) with their specificity as for binary features in MaxEnt taggers (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Hajic and Hladk, 1998)."
W04-0305	W96-0213	o	"We determined appropriate training parameters and network size based on intermediate validation 1We used a publicly available tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) to provide the tags."

W04-0834	W96-0213	o	"3.1 Part-of-Speech (POS) of Neighboring Words We use 7 features to encode this knowledge source: a0a2a1a4a3a6a5a7a0a8a1a10a9a11a5a7a0a8a1a13a12a14a5a15a0a17a16a6a5a15a0a2a12a18a5a7a0a19a9a20a5a15a0a17a3, where a0a8a1 a21 (a0 a21 ) is the POS of thea6 th token to the left (right) ofa0, and a0a17a16 is the POS of a0 . A token can be a word or a punctuation symbol, and each of these neighboring tokens must be in the same sentence asa0 . We use a sentence segmentation program (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997) and a POS tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) to segment the tokens surroundinga0 into sentences and assign POS tags to these tokens."
W05-0104	W96-0213	o	The original intention of assignment 2 was that students then use this maxent classifier as a building block of a maxent part-of-speech tagger like that of Ratnaparkhi (1996).
W05-0201	W96-0213	o	"We assign tags of part-of-speech (POS) to the words with MXPOST that adopts the Penn Treebank tag set (Ratnaparkhi, 1996)."
W05-0611	W96-0213	o	Direct feedback loops that copy a predicted output label to the input representation of the next example have been used in symbolic machine-learning architectures such as the the maximum-entropy tagger described by Ratnaparkhi (1996) and the memory-based tagger (MBT) proposed by Daelemans et al.
W05-0611	W96-0213	o	"Output sequence optimization Rather than basing classifications only on model parameters estimated from co-occurrences between input and output symbols employed for maximizing the likelihood of point-wise single-label predictions at the output level, classifier output may be augmented by an optimization over the output sequence as a whole using optimization techniques such as beam searching in the space of a conditional markov models output (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) or hidden markov models (Skut and Brants, 1998)."
W05-0806	W96-0213	o	"Therefore, the base forms have been introduced manually and the POS tags have been provided partly manually and partly automatically using a statistical maximum-entropy based POS tagger similar to the one described in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996)."

W08-0611	W96-0213	o	"2A maximum-entropy-based part of speech tagger was used (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) without the adaptation to the biomedical domain."
W09-0416	W96-0213	o	"The features we used are as follows:  Direct and inverse IBM model;  3, 4-gram target language model;  3, 4, 5-gram POS language model (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Schmid, 1994); 96  Sentence length posterior probability (Zens and Ney, 2006);  N-gram posterior probabilities within the NBest list (Zens and Ney, 2006);  Minimum Bayes Risk probability;  Length ratio between source and target sentence; The weights are optimized via MERT algorithm."
W09-0715	W96-0213	o	"Using an Maximum Entropy approach to POS tagging, Ratnaparkhi (1996) reports a tagging accuracy of 96.6% on the Wall Street Journal."
W96-0111	W96-0213	o	"Ratnaparkhi, 1996), a single inconsistency in a test set tree will very likely yield a zero percent parse accuracy for the particular test set sentence."
W97-0301	W96-0213	o	"The maximum entropy models used here are similar in form to those in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Berger, Della Pietra, and Della Pietra, 1996; Lau, Rosenfeld, and Roukos, 1993)."
W97-0301	W96-0213	o	"The training samples are respectively used to create the models PT^G, PCHUNK, PBUILD, and PCMECK, all of which have the form: k p(a, b) = II _ij(o,b ~j (1) j----1 where a is some action, b is some context, ~"" is a nor4 Model Categories Description Templates Used TAG See (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) CHUNK chunkandpostag(n)* BUILD CHECK chunkandpostag(m, n)* cons(n) cons(re, n)* cons(m, n,p) T punctuation checkcons(n)* checkcons(m,n)* production surround(n)* The word, POS tag, and chunk tag of nth leaf."
W97-0301	W96-0213	o	"The search also uses a Tag Dictionary constructed from training data, described in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), that reduces the number of actions explored by the tagging model."
W98-1116	W96-0213	p	"Models that can handle non-independent lexical features have given very good results both for part-of-speech and structural disambiguation (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Ratnaparkhi, 1998)."
W98-1117	W96-0213	o	"Its applications range from sentence boundary disambiguation (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997) to part-of-speech tagging (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), parsing (Ratnaparkhi, 1997) and machine translation (Berger et al. , 1996)."
W98-1118	W96-0213	p	"He has achieved state-of-the art results by applying M.E. to parsing (Ratnaparkhi, 1997a), part-of-speech tagging (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), and sentence-boundary detection (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997)."

W99-0607	W96-0213	p	"Our model exploits the same kind of tag-n-gram information that forms the core of many successful tagging models, for example, (Kupiec, 1992), (Merialdo, 1994), (Ratnaparkhi, 1996)."
W99-0608	W96-0213	o	"In that table, TBL stands for Brill's transformation-based error-driven tagget (Brill, 1995), ME stands for a tagger based on the maimum entropy modelling (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), SPATTER stands for a statistical parser based on decision trees (Magerman, 1996), IGTREE stands for the memory-based tagger by Daelemans et al."
